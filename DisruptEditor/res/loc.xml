    <line id="13342">Jesus.</line>
    <line id="13343">It sounds stupid, but… I think I hate her. Heh. How fucked up is that? You know what. Forget I said anything, OK? I gotta go.</line>
    <line id="13348">Did you ever resent someone so much that they don't seem human to you?</line>
    <line id="13349">What?</line>
    <line id="13350">The other night June and I were sitting there after another all-out argument. I'm rubbing her shoulders and she just keeps yapping. I didn't even know my hands had tightened.</line>
    <line id="13352">He says he'll sue us.</line>
    <line id="13353">Fuck that. Tell him we go to court, his breakdown's going public. HR's got a whole write up on it. Grown man rocking and crying at his desk. Got some pretty great boohoo shit about daddy's "hungry hands." Use that. Teach him a lesson.</line>
    <line id="13354">That's awful.</line>
    <line id="13355">That's nothing. Get rid of him or you'll find out first hand how awful I can be.</line>
    <line id="13356">Listen, we need to cut him.</line>
    <line id="13357">I can't be involved with every hiring and firing. I'm empowering you guys to handle the petty stuff.</line>
    <line id="13359">No way!</line>
    <line id="13360">Of course there I am hard as a fucking post. She's got one hand in my pants and man - nice grip. Sipping wine with the other. My brain goes - wham. I lose it.</line>
    <line id="13361">Wait… you took the sister to dinner?</line>
    <line id="13362">Yeah, not as hot, but she's got a crazy perfect ass. She's sitting next to me pulling my hand between her legs.</line>
    <line id="13363">What do you have on him?</line>
    <line id="13364">I got a video of him with a certain young man. Raw stuff.</line>
    <line id="13365">How did you get that?</line>
    <line id="13366">See That's the best part. It's out there. He just shows it in places nobody at work would look.</line>
    <line id="13367">I don't know. Could ruin me. Or could be a huge payday. But if he fucks with me, it'll be in the papers.</line>
    <line id="13368">You sound messed up.</line>
    <line id="13369">I am, man. I could go to jail…</line>
    <line id="13370">You are a dead man.</line>
    <line id="13371">What's a matter? I got connections too! The Club can suck mine. I told you I would be made partner by my second year. Not bad right?</line>
    <line id="13372">Man, I can't afford no lawyer… The wife is going to kill me. That was our mortgage money.</line>
    <line id="13373">He's a backstabbing toady fuck.</line>
    <line id="13374">You said the shipment had no side effects.</line>
    <line id="13375">I thought he'd fit in. He's smart.</line>
    <line id="13376">I worked hard to get into this program, man. So much debt. And fucker steals my work!</line>
    <line id="13377">Surprised me too. He must've tampered with it. Heard a couple people drowned in their own blood. Can you believe that shit? Good news is that he hasn't leaked too much of it yet.</line>
    <line id="13378">Sure. Listen, it's got nothing to do with how he looks or whatever religion them people are. It's about risk.</line>
    <line id="13379">How's your grandpa?</line>
    <line id="13380">Fucking gross. They put this tube in his throat. He starts talking and it makes this gurgle. The nurse has gotta pump it out. You know? To flush it. My old man is talking about pulling the plug because he's sick of looking after him. Ain't my call. Nobody even asks.</line>
    <line id="13383">I can't believe you watched.</line>
    <line id="13384">It was so fucked up, man. She's laying down, naked on top. They cut her open on the side! Like under the pit. And get this, he then peels it open like a damn pita pocket.</line>
    <line id="13389">You said you'd call…</line>
    <line id="13390">No severance?</line>
    <line id="13391">It wasn't that bad.</line>
    <line id="13393">I'm on my way to work.</line>
    <line id="13394">I can't believe the way they treat you.</line>
    <line id="13395">I'm just saying it's about eating better.</line>
    <line id="13396">I thought I was clear.</line>
    <line id="13397">Alright, alright. Calm down…</line>
    <line id="13398">- he just kept swearing at me. I told him to stop but he wouldn't. He just got madder. Why would he do that?</line>
    <line id="13399">Don't hang up on me again. I was only trying to help. Why don't you ever call her back?</line>
    <line id="13400">Then you know what he said? He called me crazy and over-emotional. That stupid bastard. I'm trying to warn him this asshole is sabotaging the project, possibly ruining the company and he calls ME crazy?</line>
    <line id="13401">Screw your lecturing. You're always on my case. That gym is really expensive. I do have other things to spend my money on, you know?</line>
    <line id="13402">Relax! I'm only calling to apologize. I don't care about whoever was texting you. And I don't care about that other hotty who was giving you the eye.</line>
    <line id="13403">He is! They sat up waiting for him until three in the damn morning. I knew I shouldn't have let him speak to them.</line>
    <line id="13404">Look, this is awkward enough, right? You have to stop calling me.</line>
    <line id="13405">Money is going to be tight. Executive management are all fucking idiots. Wastes of oxygen.</line>
    <line id="13406">No. Not as bad as that other time you threw up on that weird guy with the wandering eye.</line>
    <line id="13411">What would you do?</line>
    <line id="13412">He's my Opa. You know? My granddad. You know what? I'm gonna say something to my dad.</line>
    <line id="13415">He has been irritable lately.</line>
    <line id="13416">He's got that stupid laptop he drags everywhere. God, I should drown the stupid thing in syrup. He'd fucking love that… Oh no, one sec - I have to go. I'll call later.</line>
    <line id="13417">Because I'll just get the same shit I'm getting from you.</line>
    <line id="13418">Listen to ya, and your huffing and puffing. Just relax - or don't, I don't care. You worked hard to get clean. So don't push your family away. You are still clean, right?</line>
    <line id="13419">That's sexism.</line>
    <line id="13420">Yeah, right? Everyone thinks he's a bipolar. And you know, he's in the closet. Think I'm joking? Why is he always telling people he isn't gay? Shit. Gotta run. Talk later.</line>
    <line id="13421">Okay - okay. Don't be so defensive. You know, I only had to -</line>
    <line id="13422">I know what you did to get thin! Does Bob? Enemas and barfing… think he knows about your secret stash of surgery money? Yeah, wouldn't we all slice off some fat if we had enough dough? So screw you… Goodbye.</line>
    <line id="13423">You know, this is really getting' old.</line>
    <line id="13424">She deserved a slap. Did you see what a skank she was? Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm not as controlling or clingy as she said. I knew it'd make me sound like a head-case. I'm going to meet you after work we can talk more. See you then!</line>
    <line id="13425">What the hell did you do?</line>
    <line id="13426">Laurel hired a dog walker. Some cute thing… young…</line>
    <line id="13427">Oh man! You didn't?</line>
    <line id="13428">Look she started it! She came at me with those full juicy lips. I can't believe I'm saying any of this. Look there's no way Laurel can ever find out. You have to give me your word.</line>
    <line id="13431">Grats. But, the Club, man.</line>
    <line id="13432">Quinn ain't never gonna see me coming. Same thing goes for those crooked fucks on the force. I want to get started. Let's meet up as soon as you can.</line>
    <line id="13433">Come on!</line>
    <line id="13434">No no no, I'm serious! Like, they put the squishy jelly in - like have you ever felt it? It's like that bike seat stuff. And they just squish it in like cheese spread. Disgusting. So now she's got these huge bazoongas. Already wearing low-cut tops. And all I can think about is slimy pita pockets.</line>
    <line id="13435">I have to get to work.</line>
    <line id="13436">Okay, okay, honey. I'm just saying that Mom wants us over there by mid afternoon.</line>
    <line id="13437">So early?</line>
    <line id="13438">I know. We'll be there forever before she puts the dinner out. I get it. But you and dad can talk hockey and get ripped over dark rum. Sound good? I take your silence as agreement so I'm hanging up. Love you!</line>
    <line id="13439">What are you going to do?</line>
    <line id="13440">Those poor kids.</line>
    <line id="13441">He gets to be adored. What am I going to do? I can't tell them - well sweeties, daddy is an asshole. I'm the bad guy. Me? It'd be easier if he died. Then maybe I can start being adored. (sigh) Sorry, I have to go.</line>
    <line id="13442">I thought -</line>
    <line id="13443">Don't call or leave messages and stop calling me at work.</line>
    <line id="13444">But you -</line>
    <line id="13445">Yeah, well that was then. You act like it's the first time you've been laid. We just hung out for a bit. Listen, just… don't leave anymore messages. If you keep calling, I'll change my number.</line>
    <line id="13446">You never liked them.</line>
    <line id="13447">My exit interview was fun. People kept saying, don't burn bridges, make sure you're polite, blah blah. Fuck that. I let them have it. All ego, no skill. Stupid bastards. I'm off job hunting now. Ciao.</line>
    <line id="13448">Don't worry about me. I have some insurance… See I got emails that prove they're ripping off clients.</line>
    <line id="13451">Thanks for bringing that up.</line>
    <line id="13452">Oh YOU brought it up lady. All over him! God, you stank.</line>
    <line id="13453">Uh oh.</line>
    <line id="13454">No. I told you, I can manage this. I've been collecting the emails for a while now. They're gonna pay. That place is gonna implode and I'll be the one left sipping champagne.</line>
    <line id="13455"> Well, the bar is dark…</line>
    <line id="13456">I warned ya.</line>
    <line id="13457">They're investigating me! Like I'm running some insurance scam. They knew it was stolen! Fuck. How much kick of my goddamned money did that bastard give them? Do me a favor, man? Loan me three grand. Don't answer now. Just think about it. I'll call you later.</line>
    <line id="13458">You gotta tell your prof.</line>
    <line id="13459">Yeah I thought of that. Then I thought, fuck that. I gotta handle my shit.</line>
    <line id="13460">Oh boy.</line>
    <line id="13461">Fucking smashed his scraggly bearded face in until he agreed to confess. Aw shit, I'm late. Gotta fly.</line>
    <line id="13462">Ain't fucking good enough.</line>

I need you to steal it and drive to the download zones that I mark on your map.
You worry about the driving and I'll worry about hacking the zones so you can grab the data I need.

Should only take about 3 zone to get everything I need.

Just drive into the zones to activate the download.

Oh, and the video feed I'm looking at shows 4 guys guarding the van.

Deal with them however you want.</line>

North of the city saw up to eight inches of rain resulting in flooded basements and some power outages. Expect delays due to the flooding throughout the city for the remainder of the day. If you were hoping on a last rush of warm weather up from the Plains, you're out of luck. Instead, temperature today will be brisk due to the lake effect from an eastern cold front extending down from Canada. Expect temperatures to drop quite a bit tonight and hang over us into tomorrow.</line>

I could see how you made him feel safe. In our world we hide in the dark, behind monitors. That's the only place we feel safe. It isn't enough to say that I didn't know. That lives would be lost or that it was only a job. We know the power we have. Our skills. Lena's death, Damien's beating. I can't hate Damien for being so angry. That's something you might not understand. I wish I hadn't gone to the park to watch you. Because that was when the guilt crept in. I don't expect you to forgive me. I'm not sure I can forgive myself. When this is all over, I hope we can at least talk. Or if not... at least I can disappear. That's something I'm good at.</line>

    <line id="68498">Sorry about this guys.</line>

    <line id="68527">Well played guys, good game.</line>
    <line id="68528">Thanks for the game, guys.</line>
    <line id="68529">Hoo boy, good game.</line>
    <line id="68530">Good game, guys.</line>
    <line id="68579">Good hand.</line>
    <line id="68581">Damn. How'd you do that?</line>
    <line id="68582">Not bad, not bad at all.</line>
    <line id="68583">Ah, jeez.</line>
    <line id="68584">Embarrassing…</line>
    <line id="68585">On your left.</line>
    <line id="68586">See the gate up ahead?</line>
    <line id="68587">It's closed.</line>
    <line id="68588">Not for long.</line>
    <line id="68589">Right, Nic. Once it's open, you're gonna have to move fast.</line>
    <line id="68590">Stop.</line>
    <line id="68591">Aiden, I'm scared.</line>
    <line id="68592">I know, Nicky, but you're doing great!</line>
    <line id="68594">It was a smart move.</line>
    <line id="68595">Okay, ahead of you.</line>
    <line id="68596">I see.</line>
    <line id="68597">On your right.</line>
    <line id="68598">It was the phone call. When I heard the PA, I knew you'd know what to do.</line>
    <line id="68599">Keep moving.</line>
    <line id="68600">Wait there.</line>
    <line id="68601">Now. Run.</line>
    <line id="68602">Why is this happening?</line>
    <line id="68603">He framed you, right?</line>
    <line id="68604">I'm sorry you're involved in this.</line>

    <line id="68606">I'm okay.</line>
    <line id="68607">Careful.</line>
    <line id="68608">Well done.</line>

    <line id="68620">Abraham Lincoln Statue</line>
    <line id="68621">It took 12 years for sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to create this stoic statue of Abe. Weird that it took another 20 years for it to finally be revealed in 1926. It makes me wonder if people walked through Grant Park for 2 decades wondering what was under the tarp. More importantly, what was Honest Abe hiding under there for so long?</line>

    <line id="68856">WKZ-TV</line>
    <line id="68857">Known for the cable cars looping through this district since 1882, the Downtown Loop is the heart of Chicago, and the historical WKZ tower is the nerve center. In 1967, a radio tower on the roof picked up a unique coded transmission thought to be a message from the Russians. It was later revealed to be a hoax created by a group of college students. The coded transmission? “How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?”</line>
    <line id="69077">35 East Wacker Drive</line>
    <line id="69078">One of the tallest buildings in the world, 35 East Wacker was constructed with a specially designed car elevator to transport jewellery merchants safely into the tower. What isn't widely known is that a billion dollars' worth of jewels is rumored to be encased somewhere within this 90 year old building's walls. I have a clue where they might be, but I'm not sharing.</line>
    <line id="69079">City Hall</line>
    <line id="69080">If these walls could talk, we'd all be cynical, anti-political - yeah ... too late. The architectural design of this building is supposed to represent strength, dignity, and vigor. In a city where 470 of its politicians have been convicted of corruption in the past few decades, the word “paradox” comes to mind. So far no mayor of Chicago has ever been convicted of a crime, but a dozen of them have been entangled in scandals.</line>
    <line id="69081">Forever Sculpture</line>
    <line id="69082">We here in Chicago are as open-minded and diverse a group as it comes. That's why we don't mind when they take up space with giant, pretentious sculpture. This was one of Joseph DeMarco's first gifts to the city. He claims the title "Forever" symbolizes Chicago's resilience, but I suspect it has more to do with how long we'll have to look at the damn thing.</line>
    <line id="69086">No idea how you pulled that one off.</line>

    <line id="69090">Don't know why I even bother.</line>

Every year, they hold the now-legendary Shepherd's Pie Eating Contest. Foodies from around the world flock to Miller's Rail every July 14th to see how much beef, peas, onions, mashed potatoes, and gravy they can chow down on. A fantastic tradition, but not a good date to use the pub's restrooms.</line>

    <line id="69385">Willis Tower</line>
    <line id="69386">The Willis Tower is the tallest building in the United States of America, standing at over 1,450 feet. One fun feature of the tower is the Skydeck, where you can feel the building sway in the wind and get a view of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana. Or for you daredevils, the tower features glass balconies, so you can see why exactly you should be afraid of heights.</line>
    <line id="69387">Palin Correctional Center</line>
    <line id="69388">For almost 40 years, this geometrically curious building has been a unique but imposing symbol of law and order in Chicago. Although many prisoners have attempted to escape, no one has been able to stay free for very long. I think the building is kind of pretty, myself.</line>

The city prides itself in being able to host free concerts here. The Pavilion's acoustics are so impeccable, music performed can be heard outside the park. So those of you who love music but hate people, you're in luck!</line>
    <line id="69455">333 North Michigan Building</line>
    <line id="69457">Chicago Commerce Building</line>
    <line id="69458">The Commerce Building is the place to be for day traders in the city. High atop the tower stands a statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture. Because, you know, day traders are the farmers of the 21st century. I guess.</line>
    <line id="69459">Vault Tower</line>
    <line id="69460">This skyscraper is known for housing the headquarters of numerous banking and energy corporations. The radio show Wait, Wait… Don't Tell Me! is  taped weekly inside the auditorium. And no, your eyes are not messing with you; the tower was built to look curved.</line>
    <line id="69461">Carding Center</line>
    <line id="69462">The Carding Center is a postmodern architectural marvel. This government building features a large atrium and open concept offices, meant to symbolize transparency in the state's government. Excuse me while I roll my eyes.</line>
    <line id="69463">Leo Burnett Building</line>
    <line id="69465">Chicago Arts &amp; Sciences Center</line>
    <line id="69466">An 1897 landmark, the Chicago Arts &amp; Sciences Center is where the Mayor of Chicago traditionally welcomes presidents, royalty, and other world leaders. Besides the huge number of art exhibitions, the main reason this building is amazing is the 38 foot glass domed rotunda. They don't make them like that anymore.</line>
    <line id="69467">Saffard Memorial Fountain</line>
    <line id="69468">Saffard Fountain may be the first thing you'll see as you step onto Chicago's front lawn. It's a breathtaking representation of Lake Michigan and the states that surround it. In Wintertime, taxpayers doll it up in dazzling lights. In Summertime, if you're lucky, you can catch the siren songs of its majestic mermaid - you usually have a good twenty minutes before the cops haul him away.</line>

    <line id="69473">Triomphe Tower</line>
    <line id="69474">Named after the notorious hotel tycoon, the Triomphe Tower is an elite residential building and hotel built by the wealthy for the wealthy, and is known for its luxurious elegance and high prices. If you have the wallet for it, a night's stay in the Tri-Tow comes highly recommended, you rich so-and-so.</line>
    <line id="69475">Chicago World News Tower</line>
    <line id="69476">This neo-gothic skyscraper is the home of the Chicago World News, the most commonly-read newspaper in the Chicago area. The newspaper ran a contest in 1919, offering cash to anyone who could create the best design for their new headquarters. The contest winner, surprisingly, was a butcher. Of course, this layman's design proved to be unbuildable, so the World News hired a qualified architect to design the tower instead.</line>
    <line id="69477">John Hancock Center</line>
    <line id="69478">Nicknamed "Big John," it is one of the tallest residential buildings in the world. The 44th floor is where you'll find the pool, which is considered the highest indoor swimming pool in America. Imagine the view? It must be like doing the back stroke in clouds. Birds fly by with this, 'what the hell?' look on their faces.</line>
    <line id="69479">Ambrose Theatre</line>
    <line id="69480">The “Theater of the World” opened October 26, 1921, and is faithfully designed in the French Baroque style that is meticulously maintained to this day. Slip backstage on a tour to discover the long-running tradition of performers signing the walls. Fascinating to me that for a theatre as old as this one, not one crime has been uncovered within its gilded doors. There has to be *some* dark secrets lurking behind those plush velvet curtains.</line>

    <line id="112885">Well, the controversial re-election of Mayor Rushmore continues. Insiders are saying it was his decision to implement the smart city infrastructure program, known as ctOS network, that boosted his re-election campaign. But critics, are pointing to the recent disruptions to the network, where bridges move on their own, and traffic lights have shut down. Critics say it just proves one more hasty decision was made by the flamboyant mayor.</line>
    <line id="112888">ctOS is groundbreaking technology. We're promoting efficiency, comfort and safety.</line>

    <line id="112891">Charlotte, what makes ctOS smart?</line>
    <line id="112892">A city is a complex web of infrastructure maintenance and upkeep. Water, power, security, sewage, and transit flow. The antiquated system had these operating on their own, with disconnect from the rest of the city services. ctOS brings these systems online interconnecting them.

The report says citizens are angry over frequent power outages, traffic disruptions and other malfunctioning systems. City Hall has denied any issues, going so far as to say the report was fabricated by the hacker group known as DedSec.</line>
    <line id="116066">[Silence 2]Mayor Rushmore has given unprecedented power to the Chicago Police to expand their Cyber Task Force. The new laws will allow police to better act on threats to the ctOS. It will also allow them to "close in" on suspected members of the hacker group, DedSec.</line>

Residents are being told to lock their windows and doors and be alert to strangers in the area.</line>
    <line id="116183">Bridge construction is almost completed. The project has been a huge injection of jobs and investment for the residents of Pawnee. The project was funded by tech giant Blume, creators of ctOS, the Smart City Network.</line>

    <line id="116190">The Aiden Pearce manhunt had a breakthrough today when citizens spotted him in the middle of downtown Chicago. It was a bold action. Some citizens believe the vigilante was demonstrating that the police are inept.</line>

    <line id="139351">We're speaking with renowned psychologist, Doctor Phil Aidelman. Doctor, the city has a vigilante in its midst, as you know. But you think this is a good thing.</line>
    <line id="139352">Well, I hesitate to say 'good' but I think in a city with rising gang violence and a notorious history, citizens need to feel safe.</line>
    <line id="139353">And he makes them feel safe?</line>
    <line id="139354">He gives the illusion of safety. People shouldn't think he's a hero of course.</line>
    <line id="139355">What about his mental state? Is he just crazy?</line>
    <line id="139356">I don't like the word, crazy. He has a purpose. He's someone who has lost control, or feels out of control. In his mind, he's regaining it. He was probably a victim of a crime and this is his way of lashing out. Once he's achieved that sense of control again, he'll stop.</line>
    <line id="139357">He'll stop? Just like that?</line>
    <line id="139358">Yes. Just like that.</line>
    <line id="139360">With the vigilante roaming the city streets, we wanted to get an expert opinion. Doctor Diana Bertrand is a criminal psychologist from New York. Doctor what do you think of our vigilante?</line>
    <line id="139361">Classic hero complex. And the media is playing into his delusions. Referring to him with a catch name, reporting on every event as if it was his doing, is fuelling him on. He isn't interested in helping anyone but himself. This is a person who is selfish, possibly narcissistic. The idea that he has convinced himself that he can somehow clean the city of crime better than trained professionals is only going to result in someone being seriously hurt if not killed.</line>
    <line id="139362">What will it take to get him to stop?</line>
    <line id="139363">Incarceration. Or… death.</line>
    <line id="139434">There are a lot of opinions swirling around the Chicago vigilante known as The Fox. With us is criminal psychologist Doctor Simon Tarch. Doctor Tarch what are we to make of a vigilante?</line>
    <line id="139435">I'm not inclined to make a judgment on someone I haven't met. But it's probably safe to say that he thinks he's helping. I doubt he's thinking of long-term consequences or the collateral damage he's causing.</line>
    <line id="139436">Why now?</line>
    <line id="139437">It's difficult to say. He might have been the sort of person his whole life that tries to protect those he cares about. Or it's possible there's been some catalyst. A victim of a crime perhaps. I think whatever the reasons it's fascinating. If he's listening, I'd just caution him to take a moment to think before he acts.</line>
    <line id="139439">Police corruption, shady deals with city hall, ctOS hacking, mob bosses and a gang leader's death… with so much happening, we wanted to have our criminal psychology experts in a debate over the vigilante. There's a lot we don't know. But I want to explore these events and the idea that there has been an escalation of vigilante activity. Are they related? Doctor Tarch, we'll start with you?</line>
    <line id="139440">I think it's easy to assume there's a connection between all of the events. That somehow this was all the work of one person. But the real world doesn't work that way.</line>
    <line id="139441">I'd like to jump in -</line>
    <line id="139442">Go ahead Doctor Bertrand.</line>
    <line id="139443">This vigilante absolutely wants us all to believe he's the sole orchestrator of events. That the death of a gang leader is because of him. That going after the mob or exposing corruption is because of his actions. Even though it isn't true, he sees this all as a victory.</line>
    <line id="139444">Doctor Aidelman, you said to me early on that the vigilante had a positive affect on the citizens. Do you still believe that?</line>
    <line id="139445">Oh please.</line>
    <line id="139446">Doctor Bertrand, let's let Doctor Aidelman respond.</line>
    <line id="139447">Look, everyone - all of us - need to be made aware of the world around us more. We walk with our heads down, noses in our little computers, phones, whatever. We're in a community but we aren't part of one. Sometimes it takes a major event, sad or good, to shake us awake. Make us look up and see the world around us. It's a positive thing to see this. Warts and all. So yes, for that, he has made a city look up. Is he a hero? -</line>
    <line id="139451">Of course he isn't a hero. And you say that we need to wake up. But we pay taxes for police to protect us. We pay taxes for our infrastructure. ctOS network has made it even easier for us to pay attention to what matters.</line>
    <line id="139452">That doesn't mean we're paying attention to the right things. And maybe it allows us to be distracted, like soma in Huxley's Brave New World. Keep the masses asleep.</line>
    <line id="139453">I don't know that we need to get so philosophical.</line>
    <line id="139454">Every time you elevate his actions to this mythos, he will feel more and more superior. What now? What's to stop him? He is delusional.</line>
    <line id="139455">I think I agree, at least partially, with that.</line>
    <line id="139456">You're asking what's to stop him? I think he has stopped.</line>
    <line id="139457">No. I disagree. He'll keep going on and on. He thinks he's a hero. You think he's a hero. And before you know it, he's the monster.</line>
    <line id="139458">I think he's sad. He's a man who has no one, and probably lost someone.</line>
    <line id="139459">So then do you three at least agree that he needs help?</line>
    <line id="139460">Yes. Of course.</line>
    <line id="139461">I think he does.</line>
    <line id="139462">Most certainly.</line>
    <line id="139463">You think he's a monster now, doctor Bertrand?</line>
    <line id="139464">He's always been one.</line>
    <line id="139465">Thank you all for your time.</line>
    <line id="139468">Up next, an interview with a woman who claims to know the vigilante, 
Aiden Pearce.</line>
    <line id="139469">Renowned child psychologist, Yolanda Mendez is with us. 
Doctor Mendez, your story is extraordinary. You actually know Aiden Pearce, the man we know as the vigilante. Tell us how that came about?</line>
    <line id="139470">I met Mr. Pearce through the family, his sister.</line>
    <line id="139471">This was a surprise to us. 
We couldn't find any information about him at all. It's great that you've come forward. 
You were treating her son for trauma?</line>
    <line id="139472">Yes. Well, naturally, I can't discuss any of that. Not even their names.</line>
    <line id="139473">No, no, no, no. We wouldn't ask you to. But that's how you met Aiden Pearce. What's he like?</line>
    <line id="139474">It's impossible to say for certain what he's really like. 
He masks his personality. And he's very good at it.</line>
    <line id="139477">Is he?</line>
    <line id="139478">It isn't like someone playing poker. This is a very smart man who is looking to gain the upper hand in every situation.</line>
    <line id="139479">Bob and Alice are having a party. And they sure didn't invite Eve and Mallory. So fuck off.</line>
    <line id="139484">Doctor Mendez, it sounds like you didn't trust him at all.</line>
    <line id="139485">Not even from the start. His sister is very nice. And the little boy went through great trauma at the death of his sister.</line>
    <line id="139486">Goodness. So the vigilante's niece died? Sounds tragic.</line>
    <line id="139487">It is. The last thing the boy needed was to have such turmoil generated by his uncle.</line>
    <line id="139488">And the sister, she's a good mom?</line>
    <line id="139489">She did leave town for a while but I'm not sure why. That's when I had contact with Mr. Pearce. To look after the boy.</line>
    <line id="139490">Did you suspect he was the vigilante then?</line>
    <line id="139491">Of course not. I would've notified the authorities immediately. He's a secretive man. I couldn't have known.</line>
    <line id="139492">Doctor Mendez, do you have any idea why he did it? What switch went off in his head that made him decide to take on criminals?</line>
    <line id="139493">Oh yes. I've been a psychologist for twenty-two years, I understand people. Mr. Pearce is more secretive than most but I believe I understand him, yes.</line>
    <line id="139494">And you're writing a book.</line>
    <line id="139495">Yes I am. It's a book about the whole experience. A study on Mr. Pearce. I really wanted to explore this complex man's mind.</line>
    <line id="139496">I'm sure it'll be a fascinating read. Doctor Mendez, thank you.</line>
    <line id="139505">All In $[#VALUE]</line>
    <line id="139506">Raised $[#VALUE]</line>
    <line id="139508">Some call him a criminal while others say he's a hero. What we do know is that he's the vigilante who's been roaming the Chicago streets for months. Just who is Aiden Pearce? Our research has come up with conflicting reports. We have some evidence that he was once married. But then another report says he's never been married. We know he has a sister, but then some say he also has a brother. There's no evidence to back up most of the speculations. One definitive fact is that a young girl, Lena Pearce, was killed in a car accident. An accident that some police say was a gang hit. If this is a relation to Pearce, was that the incident that set this complex man on his quest for justice? We have a lot more to learn. We'll keep you posted.</line>

    <line id="139546">We were dirt poor. It was seven of us, my brothers, sister and me mom. She brought us here to America from Galway. Imagine that? We're happy little children, excited for a new life. New food to taste. Things we'd see and do. My sister died before we stepped foot on the soil. And so then there were six of us. It's a sour taste for me to this day.</line>
    <line id="139547">For decades, Quinn built his fortune. He's made numerous endowments to Chicago to encourage arts and education scholarship funds.</line>
    <line id="139548">She raised us to work hard. She took in washing. I delivered from shops. That meant my youngest brother was allowed to go to school. It was a very strict upbringing. A nickel was gold and it was to be treated as such. I learned the value of money very early on. That I did.</line>
    <line id="139550">But hard work wasn't getting them out of the poor house.</line>
    <line id="139558">Well, she died you see. Not much more to say on that. It was left up to me to feed the lads.</line>

    <line id="139626">[Silence 2]A body was found on the South side this morning. Sources say it was an apparent mob execution. The victim is known to police and suspected of involvement in a recent heist. He's known to have ties to the notorious crime syndicate, the Chicago South Club.</line>
    <line id="139628">Mayor Rushmore has pledged to crack down on the sporadic disruption to ctOS services. The mayor directly accused the hacker activist group, DedSec, for "wreaking havoc" on Chicago citizens. The mayor has promised to bring the group leaders to justice.</line>

    <line id="139643">Breaking news… reports are coming in that Aiden Pearce, the Vigilante known as the Fox, has been spotted in downtown Chicago. Police are asking people to remain calm. Do not approach the suspect. He is considered armed and dangerous.</line>
    <line id="139644">Police believe Pearce has been acting as a vigilante for months. He is violent and possibly unstable.</line>

One insider says the mayor was alone, and in a locked office, claiming that it would've been impossible for anyone to get in and out unseen. So was it a suicide or murder? There are no witness reports of hearing a gunshot. Police have yet to confirm this information.</line>
    <line id="139681">We knew all along that our ctOS network would be a target for hackers of all strengths and skills. It's been an excellent proving ground to demonstrate how robust our system really is. We are so pleased with the results.

    <line id="140585">Why did he do that?</line>
    <line id="140586">Marco Polo.</line>
    <line id="140587">I just can't get any sleep anymore. I wake up suddenly every half hour or so and it takes me another fifteen minutes just to fall asleep again.</line>
    <line id="140588">I offered you a place to stay, but you're going to have to follow my rules.</line>
    <line id="140589">I read about that. Sounds like it was bad.</line>
    <line id="140590">No. I can't.</line>
    <line id="140591">Does he get parole even?</line>
    <line id="140592">Is that supposed to be funny?</line>
    <line id="140593">They left her there?</line>
    <line id="140594">I didn't notice anything.</line>
    <line id="140595">He died.</line>
    <line id="140596">Don't freak out.</line>
    <line id="140597">Yeah.</line>
    <line id="140598">What if he finds out?</line>
    <line id="140599">I got to get her out of there.</line>
    <line id="140600">They got criminals running the streets, criminals running the police, criminals running City Hall. Of course I left.</line>
    <line id="140601">Do you think she'll be able to do it?</line>
    <line id="140602">They were so cruel. They hacked her account. Posted photos of her topless. She feels destroyed by all this.</line>
    <line id="140603">With a sword!</line>
    <line id="140604">Do you have a zombie apocalypse escape plan?</line>
    <line id="140606">All under the bridge, man. Just stop by. She'll be happy to see you.</line>
    <line id="140607">What. Shut up.</line>
    <line id="140608">No, what?</line>
    <line id="140609">I can't.</line>
    <line id="140610">I hooked him up with her, but he's awkward because he's uh...</line>
    <line id="140611">Your wingman?</line>
    <line id="140612">Yeah, I got um... excited while she was leaning over me to get the back teeth.</line>
    <line id="140613">The yellow box or the blue one?</line>
    <line id="140615">Hey. What's the account password again?</line>
    <line id="140616">You got in?</line>
    <line id="140617">Don't ever call me again. Don't call my friends.</line>
    <line id="140618">No, I keep it in my back pocket.</line>
    <line id="140619">What are you saying?</line>
    <line id="140620">Yeah I know him.</line>
    <line id="140621">I need a big favor from you.</line>
    <line id="140622">I'm listening.</line>
    <line id="140623">Wait a fucking minute. My voicemail is FILLED with promotional calls from YOUR company.</line>
    <line id="140624">How are you going to make it up to me?</line>
    <line id="140625">He finally got it open?</line>
    <line id="140626">How was he?</line>
    <line id="140627">What does that mean ... gone?</line>
    <line id="140628">Who? What message?</line>
    <line id="140629">I'm just ... tired. Tired of being a pillar. Tired of standing strong so everybody else can be weak.</line>
    <line id="140630">I'm not really sure. Your card didn't go through. So you'll need to come into the bank.</line>
    <line id="140631">What?</line>
    <line id="140632">I'm sorry, I realize it's inconvenient. I can check with my manager for other options.</line>
    <line id="140633">Oh? Hmm. I see.</line>
    <line id="140634">Maybe you can just give me the credit number over the phone.</line>
    <line id="140635">Uhh. No. But I'm gonna do it anyway. Ahh, it's a good idea. Who's going to know?</line>
    <line id="140636">You will.</line>
    <line id="140637">I can live with it. Seriously. I've worked my - well, you know how long I've been at this. Remember that other idea?</line>
    <line id="140638">But, this is different.</line>
    <line id="140639">It isn't! He would've stolen my ideas in a fucking heartbeat. He's gone. So I'm taking his.</line>
    <line id="140642">Ha! Well, they've moved a lot of it to the internet, of course. But you're a special long time customer.</line>
    <line id="140643">Uhh, but it's been years.</line>
    <line id="140644">Don't be so nervous, sweetie. I'm not trying to roll you for cash. I found your number in my file. Thought I'd see how you are.</line>
    <line id="140645">I don't think I had this number then.</line>
    <line id="140646">You someplace private so you can have a chat with me? You still like the same things?</line>
    <line id="140647">Uhm. I'm late for work. I should go.</line>
    <line id="140648">Jesus, what did you tell him? It sounds like he's overreacting...</line>
    <line id="140649">How my heart races when the phone rings. How I need a pee leader.</line>
    <line id="140650">A what?</line>
    <line id="140651">I know it's stupid ... but I can't pee in public unless I hear somebody else go first.</line>
    <line id="140652"> Hon, I'll be your pee leader anytime you need me to.</line>
    <line id="140653">I know I don't. Don't be so defensive. Geez. Why are you so jumpy? It's like I caught you with your pants down.</line>
    <line id="140654">My pants are all the way up.</line>
    <line id="140655">Well isn't that nice. I'm glad to hear it. Wouldn't want you to fall back in to old habits.</line>
    <line id="140656">Please. Knock louder.</line>
    <line id="140657">Oh. Nice try, I'm not falling for that.</line>
    <line id="140658">Jesus. Listen to yourself.</line>
    <line id="140659">Ugh. Don't start.</line>
    <line id="140660">There are a number of tests we still need to do. We'll need to see you in again. Hmm, as soon as possible.</line>
    <line id="140661">So it's serious.</line>
    <line id="140662">It's good to make sure we get our test results in as quickly as possible. There are a number of possibilities.</line>
    <line id="140663">It's serious.</line>
    <line id="140664">I'm sorry.</line>
    <line id="140665">Well. Okay then.</line>
    <line id="140672">That's so weird. I don't know why it keeps dialing your number. I swear I fixed it.</line>
    <line id="140673">Okay, so if I accidentally call again. It's okay if you don't answer. Oh wait. If you don't answer then how will I know that I got the right number? I mean the wrong number.</line>
    <line id="140674">You do whatever works for you.</line>
    <line id="140675">Okay. I know. I'll text instead. If it's the wrong number then you can text me back -</line>
    <line id="140677">Shit!</line>
    <line id="140679">Just take what you want, pal!</line>
    <line id="140681">Whoa, there!</line>
    <line id="140683">For the love of God, don't shoot!</line>
    <line id="140685">Oh, crap!</line>
    <line id="140715">Oh, no. What did he do?</line>
    <line id="140716">Look man, grandma died less than a year ago, right--but she's always taken care of the old guy. Apparently, he just got himself a new girlfriend. How freaky is that?</line>
    <line id="140717">Uh oh. So what did he post?</line>
    <line id="140718">That this new woman was "sent from Heaven" by Grandma to keep him happy for the rest of his years. Ew.</line>
    <line id="140719">Ewwww... what does "happy" mean?</line>
    <line id="140720">Ewwww.</line>
    <line id="140722">Okay, but you aren't listening.</line>
    <line id="140725">Is he the drinker?</line>
    <line id="140727">Walk away, man. This could get ugly.</line>
    <line id="140729">I'm gonna give you a chance to leave. You'd better take it.</line>
    <line id="140731">Put the gun away and get out, now.</line>
    <line id="140733">You don't want to mess with me, friend.</line>
    <line id="140735">I've got a gun! I know how to use it!</line>
    <line id="140737">I'm not serving you.</line>
    <line id="140739">Take your business elsewhere.</line>
    <line id="140741">I don't want any trouble. Go away!</line>
    <line id="140743">That's it. I've got nothing for you.</line>
    <line id="140745">I know who you are, and I know you're not wanted here. Please leave.</line>
    <line id="140747">Finding everything okay?</line>
    <line id="140749">Anything I can help you with?</line>
    <line id="140753">If you have any questions, just let me know.</line>
    <line id="140755">What is it you're looking for today?</line>
    <line id="140756">Of course it's their problem! They're they ones that got hacked. They're a bank for fuck's sake!</line>
    <line id="140757">Don't yell at me! What was I supposed to say?</line>
    <line id="140758">Forget it. I'll do it myself. I don't know why I thought you'd be able--</line>
    <line id="140759">Hey, fuck you! Maybe if you'd leave the house once in a while and help pay the fucking bills.</line>
    <line id="140761">Thanks so much.</line>
    <line id="140763">Take care, now.</line>
    <line id="140765">Have a nice day!</line>
    <line id="140767">Come back anytime.</line>
    <line id="140769">See you.</line>
    <line id="140776">How you doing?</line>
    <line id="140778">What can I do for you?</line>
    <line id="140780">Nice day, isn't it?</line>
    <line id="140782">Hey! How's it going?</line>
    <line id="140784">Welcome!</line>
    <line id="140786">Okay, okay!</line>
    <line id="140788">Don't hurt me!</line>
    <line id="140790">I don't wanna die!</line>
    <line id="140792">Alright, alright!</line>
    <line id="140794">Please, please!</line>
    <line id="140805">I am listening. Mom is going to have to sell it. I don't see any other option. Do you have the money?</line>
    <line id="140806">No.</line>
    <line id="140807">Well, I sure as hell don't. So stop telling her she doesn't have to.</line>
    <line id="140808">Fine.</line>
    <line id="140809">Don't get snarky. You don't have a better plan, do you? So that's that.</line>
    <line id="140811">Come back if you change your mind.</line>
    <line id="140813">Thanks, anyway.</line>
    <line id="140815">Have a good day.</line>
    <line id="140817">Okay.</line>
    <line id="140819">This stuff won't be here forever.</line>
    <line id="140842">The police'll be here soon!</line>
    <line id="140844">The cops are coming, man. You'd better go!</line>
    <line id="140846">I'd leave before the cops show up, if I were you.</line>
    <line id="140848">The police are on their way. Get out of here!</line>
    <line id="140850">If you stick around any longer, you're going to be arrested.</line>
    <line id="140872">Get out, or I'll shoot!</line>
    <line id="140874">This can go one of two ways. Think it through.</line>
    <line id="140876">Go, before you do something you'll regret.</line>
    <line id="140878">Leave now, I'm warning you.</line>
    <line id="140880">I'm armed! Don't mess with me!</line>
    <line id="140902">So long!</line>
    <line id="140904">Thanks for stopping by!</line>
    <line id="140906">Alright, then.</line>
    <line id="140908">Thank you!</line>
    <line id="140910">Come again, we're open seven days a week!</line>
    <line id="140932">Hey, hey, hey!</line>
    <line id="140934">Whoa!</line>
    <line id="140936">Please, man! Don't do it!</line>
    <line id="140938">What the--!</line>
    <line id="140940">Don't shoot, don't shoot!</line>
    <line id="140942">Hey, there.</line>
    <line id="140944">Hello!</line>
    <line id="140946">Can I help you?</line>
    <line id="140948">Welcome!</line>
    <line id="140950">How you doing?</line>
    <line id="140952">Hey, need a hand?</line>
    <line id="140954">What can I do to help?</line>
    <line id="140956">Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.</line>
    <line id="140958">I'm here if you need anything.</line>
    <line id="140960">Looking for something in particular?</line>
    <line id="140971">Yup. Guy reeks of it after lunch. I can't figure out how they can't smell it on him.</line>
    <line id="140972">Does he act drunk?</line>
    <line id="140973">No! That's what's crazy. He smells like a frat house kegger but somehow manages to breeze through these meetings. He's all blah blah blah smooth.</line>
    <line id="140974">Wow.</line>
    <line id="140975">I know, right? That's some old timey skills. God, I wish he'd retire or keel over so I can get his office.</line>
    <line id="140977">Can't believe you said that.</line>
    <line id="140984">The one I want to go to is in Big Sur. Right when you check in there's no phone, TV or anything electronic. Imagine shutting off the world?</line>
    <line id="140985">I don't know that I could do that.</line>
    <line id="140986">Sure you could. You need to. Everyone should. It's the new thing. Wanna come with?</line>
    <line id="140987">I don't know. How much?</line>
    <line id="140988">Two grand.</line>
    <line id="140989">A night? You're insane. Without the internet?</line>
    <line id="140990">It's totally worth it.</line>
    <line id="140995">Uhh, side effects are dry mouth, headaches, some crap with your liver. Oh, and you can die.</line>
    <line id="140996">Very funny.</line>
    <line id="140997">Think I'm joking? Not kidding. Are you sure you need this shit? What the hell's wrong with you anyways?</line>
    <line id="140998">Nevermind. Ugh.</line>
    <line id="140999">Better head straight here. I'll medicate you with booze first. Meet me at the place.</line>
    <line id="141005">You sure?</line>
    <line id="141006">If you say so. I thought we hit it off, you know? I mean I get that but -</line>
    <line id="141007">Listen, I-I got to go.</line>
    <line id="141008">No wait. Tell me why. Seriously. You can tell me. I get this a lot, so I want to know. How'd I do?</line>
    <line id="141009">I really have to go.</line>
    <line id="141010">No, hang on. Hear me out. Please?</line>
    <line id="141014">Okay, okay, okay, just don't shoot!</line>
    <line id="141016">Sorry!</line>
    <line id="141018">Fine!</line>
    <line id="141020">I didn't do anything!</line>
    <line id="141021">It's not a spoiler. I promise. It's so good. He finds her email to him in the sent folder.</line>
    <line id="141022">Spoiler.</line>
    <line id="141023">It isn't. A bunch of other stuff happens too. It's a good movie. You should see it.</line>
    <line id="141024">Sure, yeah.</line>
    <line id="141054">Ocean Tower</line>
    <line id="141055">This striking skyscraper is unique to Chicago for many reasons. Not only does it feature one-of-a-kind, undulating balconies that give the building a watery quality, it is also the tallest building in the world to have a woman as lead architect. Girl power!</line>

This is one of the finest universities in the country, well known for its Geology, Interpretive Dance, and Astrobiology departments. Their football team, the South Tech Sandtippers, is expected to do well this season. Go, Sandtippers!</line>
    <line id="141070">Harbor Lighthouse</line>
    <line id="141071">Harbor Lighthouse has been a beacon to passing ships and teenagers looking for a place to make out since it was built in 1893. At the time it was considered state of the art engineering and has always been upgraded accordingly. The lens is extremely rare. So here's hoping it lasts longer than the light bulb in my bathroom.</line>

    <line id="141074">Bar</line>
    <line id="141076">Cafe</line>
    <line id="141078">Navy Pier Building</line>
    <line id="141079">Welcome to Chicago's #1 tourist attraction! The Navy Pier is home to museums, boat tours, and an amusement park. The Navy Pier is also known as Municipal Pier #2, which makes me wonder why it isn't #1. And where is Municipal Pier #1, anyway? </line>
    <line id="141080">Restaurant</line>

    <line id="141083">Avast, ye land lubbers! This be the finest seafaring vessel among these here islands, so climb aboard and feast upon the finest catches of the sea. Ye will feel like a pirate who's found buried treasure, and, uh… walk the plank. Sorry, I lost the metaphor there.</line>
    <line id="141084">Water Tower</line>
    <line id="141085">The Chicago Water Tower was built in 1869, and was one of the few buildings in the city to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Which makes sense, if you think about it. After all, it is a water tower, right? Upon seeing it, Oscar Wilde called the water tower a "monstrosity." What does he know?</line>
    <line id="141086">Crowley Building</line>
    <line id="141087">When construction began in 1920, the Crowley Building was the first major office building north of the Chicago River. Take a look around now! Originally owned by the government, Crowley is rumored to have been the site of a top-secret laboratory specializing in hallucinogenics. In 1947, the building became privately owned, and the government left no trace of their work behind.</line>
    <line id="141088">Burned Down Factory</line>
    <line id="141089">A modern-day relic, this old factory serves as a reminder of the perils of love and obsession. The story goes that an employee, spurned by the love of his life, walked into work wearing dynamite on his belt, and brought the building down around him. He left a note saying that this was meant to be "one last gift" for his true love. I'm sure she would've been content with flowers.</line>
    <line id="141090">Rossi-Fremont</line>
    <line id="141091">The infamous Rossi-Fremont Low Income Housing Co-op was doomed from the start. Idealists thought they could build an instant community, but decades of poor infrastructure, policing, and funding has turned it into more of a gang-ridden prison. Many of the citizens living here are trapped. If Chicago is focusing on being a smarter city, let's hope they stop being stupid about this place.</line>
    <line id="141092">Sienna Brick Factory</line>
    <line id="141093">Known as 'the old rail station', Sienna Brick Factory not only provided building materials to the region, it was also famous for being featured in the 1985 horror classic The Stone Cold Killer. For you film buffs, the bloodcurdling climax between rookie cop Kate Houston and the SCK was filmed on the rooftop. The Stone Cold Killer had his iconic death on the pile of cinder blocks next to the building!</line>
    <line id="141094">Cermak Bridge</line>
    <line id="141095">Named after one of Chicago's notable mayors, the Cermak bridge helps connect commuters from the suburbs to the downtown core. A common site for local suicides, a small grassroots organization has dedicated itself to monitoring the bridge 24/7. Members sing cheerful songs, strike up conversations, and give flowers to passersby who look like they want to end their lives. Suicides on this bridge have since decreased.</line>
    <line id="141096">The Yacht Club</line>
    <line id="141097">Not to be confused with that other, more prestigious Yacht Club, this boat lot is still a wonderful place to visit if you like yachts, boats, or any type of water vehicle. Limitations in their budget means they can only afford to hold races from the Club to a buoy a few yards out and back. At least they have fun.</line>
    <line id="141098">Lakeshore Water Refinery</line>
    <line id="141099">The Lakeshore Water Refinery has a long and spooky history. In 1954, an employee on the graveyard shift fell into one of the refinery's reservoirs, and drowned. While the subsequent city-wide panic over the cleanliness of their water was short-lived, it is believed that the worker's ghost still haunts the reservoir. Some employees claim to feel something trying to push them in as well. Maybe it's the wind. Yeah, it's... just the wind.</line>
    <line id="141100">Windy City Shipyards</line>
    <line id="141101">Tens of thousands of shipping containers have moved in and out of the shipyard every year for over a century. The Windy City Shipyards is one of Chicago's most vital lifelines, and lately, with so much mob activity near the yards, it might become one of Chicago's most notorious. Not a place you want to go fishing, if you catch my drift.</line>
    <line id="141102">Phoebus Theater</line>
    <line id="141103">While it seems diminutive compared to its bigger brothers in the city, the Phoebus Theater remains a popular venue for comedians and entertainers. In 1989, legendary funnyman Domingo Mendez performed for eight straight hours, using only a toothbrush as a prop for over 200 sketches and bits. The audience was both impressed and tired.</line>
    <line id="141104">Botanical Gardens</line>
    <line id="141105">Brimming with magnificent flora since 1992, the Botanical Gardens serves as a reminder of how important it is to preserve the natural beauty of our world. The statues that populate the courtyard were donated by oil baron Kurt Igmar, giving the gardens an air of Greek classicism and cruel irony. Allergy medication is available for purchase in the gift shop.</line>
    <line id="141106">St. Joseph Cemetery</line>
    <line id="141107">Among the tombstones of honest, hardworking men and women, there is one grave site in the cemetery that is particularly notable. Dug into the cemetery's mountain, bearing a sculpture of his likeness, is the grand tomb of Finnegan Jones, Chicago's most popular Lincoln impersonator. Upon his death, Jones received a state funeral attended by over 1000 adoring fans.</line>
    <line id="141108">Farris Halstead Library</line>
    <line id="141109">The Farris Halstead Library may not be much to look at from the outside, but it provides a valuable service to the community. The library is a popular gathering place for local youth. They use its parking lot to skateboard, play basketball, and find love. If they were to ever go inside the library, they would also find a lot of books.</line>
    <line id="141110">City Marina</line>
    <line id="141111">The marina is a Hotspot for boating enthusiasts. It has only recently begun to shake off its notorious crime history. Between 1960 and 1966, police found nearly a dozen bodies near the marina, with evidence indicating they were unsuccessfully weighed down. Although no charges were ever officially made, these deaths were all believed to be the work of the Chicago South Club.</line>
    <line id="141112">Owl Motel</line>
    <line id="141113">This quiet little motel had its own short moment of heated excitement in 1967, when an informant crucial to the conviction of Sam "Teets" Battaglia was kept under wraps in room 205. For the time of Battaglia's trial, the informant, Joseph Joyce, had to be moved repeatedly to escape being murdered by Battaglia's men. The Owl Motel was Joyce's last relocation before he took the stand, putting away Battaglia for good.</line>
    <line id="141114">Piper Gate</line>
    <line id="141115">The Piper Gate serves as the starting point for Chicago's annual Cinco de Mayo street festival. For an entire weekend, this small corner of Chicago comes to life in a celebration of Mexican music, food, and culture. It is one of my personal favorite things to do in the city. Try to find me next year! I'll be the one gorging myself on pupusas and trying to talk up the tango dancers.</line>
    <line id="141116">May Stadium</line>
    <line id="141117">May Stadium is a great place to catch a game. Built in 1901, the May was one of the first large-scale baseball venues in the country. Sit yourself among 35,000 fans for a game. When you're hungry, chow down on a tasty hot dog from the stadium's concession stand. Just make sure you have a shot of penicillin handy, because you'll need it!</line>
    <line id="141118">Abandoned Station</line>
    <line id="141119">This incomplete train station was the infamous setting of a blood-soaked shootout between the Chicago South Club and law enforcement on September 3rd, 1955. Three police officers were brutally gunned down on the station's platform, while five Club members escaped unharmed. This shootout became so romanticized, it inspired copycat murders in and around the unfinished station. As a result, work was soon abandoned.</line>
    <line id="141120">Blume</line>
    <line id="141121">Besides being the inception of our smart city ctOS network, Blume is involved in lots of high tech research and development. Behind that scary super secret security, we may never known what that tech is. I do, however, try every now and then to sift through their dumpsters and see if I can find a hover car or ray gun.</line>
    <line id="141122">Beach</line>
    <line id="141124">Bridge Construction</line>
    <line id="141125">Due to the barriers encountered in attempting to replace neighboring bridges, the municipal government has begun construction on a more modern connection to the rest of the city of Chicago. The bridge has yet to be named, but for the sake of promotion, developers Barbieri &amp; Salcedo are currently accepting suggestions on their website. Keep it cheerful! We don't want jumpers.</line>
    <line id="141126">Dam</line>
    <line id="141127">The Pawnee Dam was built in 1936 in an effort to push back the Pawnee River and facilitate development in this outskirt of Chicago. The dam was a success until the Illinois drought of 1981 caused the Pawnee River to dry up. Now the dam stands there, not really serving a purpose besides being a historical monument. Tours are available on select dates, so if you're into hydroelectrical engineering, you will have a ball.</line>
    <line id="141128">Gas Station</line>
    <line id="141130">Junkyard</line>
    <line id="141131">This junkyard is owned by a pair of eccentrics who pride themselves in their highly vicious guard dogs, whom they publicly revealed were imported from Belgium and trained in the toughest guard dog academies of Bruges. The problem is, no one has actually seen these dogs. And the barking sounds recorded. No matter! Criminals avoid the yard anyway. Why take chances?</line>
    <line id="141132">Pawnee Mill</line>
    <line id="141133">This Pawnee fixture has provided the state with quality lumber for over one hundred years. But a certain unsavory event occurred here at the turn of the century. Let's just say it involved an evil, moustache-twirling Count, a damsel who was tied to the mill's conveyor belt, and a dashing rogue who saved the day. Apparently that sort of thing was common back in the day.</line>
    <line id="141134">Crazy Moose Inn</line>
    <line id="141135">This is the Crazy Moose Inn. They serve breakfast, when management decides to finally crawl out of bed.</line>
    <line id="141136">Pawnee Trailer Park</line>
    <line id="141137">Welcome to the Pawnee "Mobile Home and Alternative Living Community." If city life and all the stresses that come with it are becoming too much for you, then a community such as this might be the place for you. After all, the only thing better than a house is a house on wheels!</line>
    <line id="141138">Vyvyn K. Turner Bridge</line>
    <line id="141139">The Vyvyn K. Turner Bridge, nicknamed "the Vyv," has won the title of "Finest Covered Bridge" from the Illinois Board of Covered Bridge Appreciation, a record ten times! The IBCBA has played a significant role in preventing the Vyv Bridge from being demolished and replaced with something safer and more reliable. It really is a nice bridge, isn't it?</line>

    <line id="141689">Cops'll be here soon.</line>
    <line id="141691">This is gonna end badly for you if you don't bolt.</line>
    <line id="141693">You walked into the wrong shop today, buddy.</line>
    <line id="141695">You're in it now, pal. You'd better run.</line>
    <line id="141697">Yeah?</line>
    <line id="141699">What can I get you?</line>
    <line id="141701">Need something?</line>
    <line id="141703">How goes it?</line>
    <line id="141705">I take my business very seriously. Don't waste my time.</line>
    <line id="141712">Kay. What do I gotta do?</line>
    <line id="141713">So I wrote those too.</line>
    <line id="141715">You'll laugh.</line>
    <line id="141719">Do I have to?</line>
    <line id="141721">That's all I know.</line>
    <line id="141723">She looks fat.</line>
    <line id="141724">Ain't it dangerous?</line>
    <line id="141725">I'm gonna do it.</line>
    <line id="141726">Can you blame her?</line>
    <line id="141727">I'm not.</line>
    <line id="141730">I'm telling you they kick ass.</line>
    <line id="141731">He's ugly. And his breath is bad.</line>
    <line id="141862">WARNING</line>
    <line id="141863">The security chief is escaping by car.</line>
    <line id="141875">Use it wisely.</line>
    <line id="141877">Thanks.</line>
    <line id="141879">Okay.</line>
    <line id="141881">See you around.</line>
    <line id="141883">Buh-bye.</line>
    <line id="141895">Whatever.</line>
    <line id="141897">'Kay.</line>
    <line id="141899">Move on.</line>
    <line id="141901">Right, right.</line>
    <line id="141903">Uh-huh.</line>
    <line id="141905">Yeah?</line>
    <line id="141907">What?</line>
    <line id="141909">Need something?</line>
    <line id="141911">So, you know what you want?</line>
    <line id="141913">What's up?</line>
    <line id="141925">No chump price for you.</line>
    <line id="141927">For you, I'll take a few bucks off. Just keep it to yourself.</line>
    <line id="141929">I'll be straight with you, as long as you're straight with me.</line>
    <line id="141931">My man. What do you need?</line>
    <line id="141933">Toast of the goddamn town, in my establishment. What's up?</line>
    <line id="141935">Speed it up, for fuck's sake.</line>
    <line id="141937">Faster. Making me nervous.</line>
    <line id="141939">Just pick something.</line>
    <line id="141941">Hurry. The. Fuck. Up.</line>
    <line id="141943">This isn't a boutique. Pick up the pace.</line>
    <line id="141997">She's our sister.</line>
    <line id="141998">She was only supposed to live with us for two months. It's been almost a year!</line>
    <line id="141999">She was dying.</line>
    <line id="142000">She's been fine for almost two years. She can start paying some bills.</line>
    <line id="142001">But I can't make her do that.</line>
    <line id="142002">Guess who has to pay her creditors? That's right, mom and dad. Still feel bad now? You're taking her. Today!</line>
    <line id="142003">What if you get caught?</line>
    <line id="142004">So? I don't fuckin' care. They got some mansion outside the city. Use their fancy condo for going to them glitter shows and shit.</line>
    <line id="142005">That's so cool.</line>
    <line id="142006">These new credit cards with that whats-it thing, chip or whatever. Some joints just scan it and hand it back to ya. Fucking crazy! No signing nothing. Just zap and there you go, free money. I'll show you when we meet up.</line>
    <line id="142007">No way! You didn't--</line>
    <line id="142008"> I swear I tried to stop… OH my God, it's so embarrassing. But come on! Playing with myself in the in-laws' car. It's funny!</line>
    <line id="142009">Seems... awkward.</line>
    <line id="142010">It's all how you sit. If those guys had pulled up alongside when I just got started then, yeah, I probably would've stopped right away. But man, I was in the throes of it. Well, thought you'd get a kick out of that. Bye!</line>
    <line id="142011">I can't believe you fell asleep.</line>
    <line id="142012">Yo, I'm saying the flick was dead dull. I refuse to be responsible for shit that may or may not escape my orifices when I am sleeping.</line>
    <line id="142013">Wait -- what?</line>
    <line id="142014">Yeah. Trev shakes me awake, cracking up, says -- you farted. No shit, I could still smell it. Audience probably wanted to thank me for bringing some excitement to that boring fucking movie.</line>
    <line id="142015">You sure?</line>
    <line id="142016">I almost have enough stashed away. Maybe not enough to move way up town. But enough to get us out of this shit heap.</line>
    <line id="142017">I just don't get why you have to leave so fast?</line>
    <line id="142018">Stop worrying. I'm not doing the gang shit again. I promise. This dough was earned fair and square. It'd be nice to have a bit more, though. Gotta go, baby, talk soon.</line>
    <line id="142029">No.</line>
    <line id="142031">I'm not sure.</line>
    <line id="142032">I'm jealous.</line>
    <line id="142033">Are you sure about this?</line>
    <line id="142099">Okay, okay.</line>
    <line id="142175">You're going down, pal.</line>
    <line id="142177">The cops are coming, and there's nothing you can do about it!</line>
    <line id="142179">Go, while you still have time!</line>
    <line id="142181">That's the last time you rob an innocent man!</line>
    <line id="142183">The police are on their way. You're finished!</line>
    <line id="142185">Come back if you change your mind.</line>
    <line id="142187">Thanks, anyway.</line>
    <line id="142189">Have a good day.</line>
    <line id="142191">Okay.</line>
    <line id="142193">Very well.</line>
    <line id="142205">Okay, okay…</line>
    <line id="142207">Okay, just don't shoot!</line>
    <line id="142209">Sorry!</line>
    <line id="142211">Fine!</line>
    <line id="142213">That was a mistake!</line>
    <line id="142225">Just stay calm, just stay calm...</line>
    <line id="142227">Don't hurt me!</line>
    <line id="142229">I don't want to die!</line>
    <line id="142231">Alright!</line>
    <line id="142233">Please, please!</line>
    <line id="142234">And did you hand it in yet?</line>
    <line id="142235">I don't want you doing anything you'll regret. That's all I'm saying. It's funny, I was thinking about when we were in college. You couldn't make up your mind. So you quit.</line>
    <line id="142236">Uhh. Do we have to talk about that?</line>
    <line id="142237">I'm not saying you're a quitter all of the time. But you do have a tendancy to-</line>
    <line id="142242">You have to see a doctor. Don't mess around with this shit. Seriously.</line>
    <line id="142243">It's okay.</line>
    <line id="142244">God. You're stubborn. It is not okay. I'm going to check to see if there's a clinic near you. That way you can know for sure.</line>
    <line id="142255">Don't, you don't have to do that.</line>
    <line id="142256">You don't understand my brother. He doesn't take advice. Especially not mine.</line>
    <line id="142257">He's going to have to start.</line>
    <line id="142258">I just don't see how it will help--he'll still owe money. Unless you've got about 3 thousand in loose change, there's nothing we can do.</line>
    <line id="142259">We can call the police.</line>
    <line id="142260">Out of the question. You underestimate these people. They have people inside the prison, too. That's a death sentence.</line>
    <line id="142261">Aww. I can't get over it. I'm so excited.</line>
    <line id="142262">I guess so.</line>
    <line id="142263">I know it's only a commercial. But it's a big one. God. Don't you think it's great news?</line>
    <line id="142264">I said it was. Didn't I?</line>
    <line id="142270">So I'll be heading out soon. But I haven't I haven't told no one. Except you.</line>
    <line id="142271">Yeah. I mean, yeah. It's the only thing I can do. Don't want to be here no more.</line>
    <line id="142272">But the Army. Yikes.</line>
    <line id="142273">It's good. Teach me lots. Room and board. Yeah. It's, it's uhh, good.</line>
    <line id="142283">On what?</line>
    <line id="142284">On us. It's just not working. It can't work.</line>
    <line id="142285">Come on. We knew it would be rough. Don't say this. Don't.</line>
    <line id="142286">I'm sorry. You don't know how much.</line>
    <line id="142287">Don't.</line>
    <line id="142288">I'm sorry.</line>
    <line id="142290">Shit, son, you need to go! You ain't taking me down with you!</line>
    <line id="142292">Beat it, punk! Don't bring no police around here!</line>
    <line id="142294">I can't do nothin' for you, man! Run!</line>
    <line id="142296">I ain't stickin' my neck out for you! They bust you, they'll try to bust me, too!</line>
    <line id="142298">Crazy motherfucker! You need to go now!</line>
    <line id="142299">No way. I can deal with the names and the vandalism, but they haven't been physical. I want to keep it that way.</line>
    <line id="142300">That's just it. It will stay that way if you let it. Things won't get better. I know a thing or two about bullies.</line>
    <line id="142301">They aren't bullies. I'm an adult, for fuck's sake. You make me feel like a kid.</line>
    <line id="142302">Because you're acting like one.</line>
    <line id="142303">Oh my god. Stop being such a prude. What a nag you are.</line>
    <line id="142304">I'm not. I just don't like it.</line>
    <line id="142305">No. You are. Nothing's ever right for you. You're always pecking away at the rest of us. If you don't like having a good time, then fine. But stop being -</line>
    <line id="142306">Well, sure you do. There's so many temptations. Especially in the city. I don't know how you've managed so far.</line>
    <line id="142307">It's not easy.</line>
    <line id="142308">Well good for you for coming along so far. Pray to God that you can stay strong.</line>
    <line id="142316">Think it's a bad idea?</line>
    <line id="142317">Think so? But we've hung out a few times. She's way cooler than anyone I've ever dated before. I think she's into me too.</line>
    <line id="142318">What girl wouldn't be?</line>
    <line id="142319">Oh yeah? Hey, thanks. You know. I'm glad we can talk about this. Anyway, she's cool. I'm gonna ask her. It'll be cool.</line>
    <line id="142320">Sure. It'll be real cool.</line>
    <line id="142321">I do! Do you?</line>
    <line id="142322">Just got it. And it is ... skimpy.</line>
    <line id="142323">Alright. So you're coming over later to gear up before we go to war?</line>
    <line id="142324">Are you sure I'm going to look good in this?</line>
    <line id="142325">Honey, you've worked your ass off ... literally ... to lose all that weight. That means you get to wear whatever you want.</line>
    <line id="142326">You're right. Of course you're right.</line>
    <line id="142331">Do it. Do it! You need a change. You're bored. You said so. So do it.</line>
    <line id="142332">But -</line>
    <line id="142333">No buts! Always buts with you. Well, always butts with me too, but that's another story.</line>
    <line id="142334">Geez.</line>
    <line id="142335">You love me! You know you do!</line>
    <line id="142340">I did. What are these for?</line>
    <line id="142341">Heartburn. Headaches. You know.</line>
    <line id="142342">You're not being honest with me. Since when did you need antidepressants? Are you depressed?</line>
    <line id="142343">It's complicated...</line>
    <line id="142344">What's complicated? Why are you pretending we're happy if we're not happy? That's not fair.</line>
    <line id="142345">No, listen. They can do that nowadays. They know all your social network stuff and follow you with your phone. That means they can predict where you'll go, and what you'll do when you get there. Before you do it.</line>
    <line id="142346">They can't guess what books I want, so -</line>
    <line id="142347">I only meant that it wasn't that great. Nothing personal.</line>
    <line id="142348">Seems kind of personal.</line>
    <line id="142349">Don't be overly defensive. You asked. All I said was -</line>
    <line id="142350">Yeah. I heard you the first time.</line>
    <line id="142352">As far as you're concerned, this shop is closed.</line>
    <line id="142354">I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around and walk out of here.</line>
    <line id="142356">If you're on TV, you're too hot to handle.</line>
    <line id="142358">Look, I've got nothing to sell you.</line>
    <line id="142360">No way! You can't be in here.</line>
    <line id="142482">You looking for something one of a kind?</line>
    <line id="142484">You alright?</line>
    <line id="142488">Just keep your hands to yourself, okay?</line>
    <line id="142490">I'm here, if you have any questions.</line>
    <line id="142492">Alright, fine. Don't shoot.</line>
    <line id="142494">Okay, okay!</line>
    <line id="142496">Just relax, take it easy. Take whatever you want.</line>
    <line id="142498">Great, just great!</line>
    <line id="142500">Anything you want, it's yours!</line>
    <line id="142502">Too bad.</line>
    <line id="142504">Feeling cheap?</line>
    <line id="142506">Aw, well.</line>
    <line id="142508">No worries.</line>
    <line id="142510">Ain't that a shame?</line>
    <line id="142512">Whoa, whoa, whoa! You need to go!</line>
    <line id="142514">Shop just closed. Permanently.</line>
    <line id="142516">If you're wanted by the cops, you're not wanted here.</line>
    <line id="142518">Shit! You--you--get out!</line>
    <line id="142520">That's it. Turn around.</line>
    <line id="142522">Yeah?</line>
    <line id="142524">What can I get you?</line>
    <line id="142526">Need something?</line>
    <line id="142528">Hey.</line>
    <line id="142530">Good day to buy something.</line>
    <line id="142532">You don't get to running a pawn shop by letting rats like you come in and rob the place.</line>
    <line id="142534">You think you can take me? I'm armed to the teeth!</line>
    <line id="142536">I'll kill you if I have to.</line>
    <line id="142538">You remind me of a bug waiting to get crushed. You want to get crushed?</line>
    <line id="142540">You're about to enter a world of hurt, friend. Get out before it's too late.</line>
    <line id="142542">Itchy trigger finger? I sure hope not.</line>
    <line id="142544">This is gonna do a number on my acid reflux.</line>
    <line id="142546">Let's get this over with, okay?</line>
    <line id="142548">Don't you have a mama, pal? What would she think?</line>
    <line id="142550">Come on, man. Don't do this.</line>
    <line id="142552">Damn!</line>
    <line id="142554">Okay, okay, okay!</line>
    <line id="142556">Thought I'd try.</line>
    <line id="142558">Sorry!</line>
    <line id="142560">Fuck!</line>
    <line id="142562">And here come the cops!</line>
    <line id="142564">You failed. Now you get to deal with the police.</line>
    <line id="142566">You just bought yourself a one-way ticket to prison!</line>
    <line id="142568">Nobody robs me! Nobody!</line>
    <line id="142570">You left me no choice. Run!</line>
    <line id="142572">Thank you for coming.</line>
    <line id="142574">Good choice.</line>
    <line id="142576">Take care of yourself.</line>
    <line id="142578">See ya.</line>
    <line id="142580">No refunds.</line>
    <line id="142583">You want me to help you out? You're gonna have to stop dragging your feet.</line>
    <line id="142584">Don't let him get away!</line>
    <line id="142585">What are you after?</line>
    <line id="142709">Whatever you want, odds are I've got it.</line>
    <line id="142711">Is there something in particular I can get you?</line>
    <line id="142713">What are you looking for? You can tell me.</line>
    <line id="142715">Pretty nice stuff, huh?</line>
    <line id="142717">Almost too hard to choose something, right?</line>
    <line id="142719">The hell--?</line>
    <line id="142721">Geez!</line>
    <line id="142723">Oh okay man, don't lose it, alright!</line>
    <line id="142725">Easy with that!</line>
    <line id="142727">What are you doing?!</line>
    <line id="142729">Take your time, think it over.</line>
    <line id="142731">What, my deal's not good enough?</line>
    <line id="142733">I've got a feeling you'll be back.</line>
    <line id="142735">I see. No hard feelings.</line>
    <line id="142737">Uh-huh.</line>
    <line id="142739">Time to say goodbye!</line>
    <line id="142741">Hey sorry, man, you just became a liability. You gotta go.</line>
    <line id="142743">Hey no no no not so fast! You and me are done, professionally!</line>
    <line id="142745">Wait, wait! That's you? No no no, you better back it up.</line>
    <line id="142747">Time to go our separate ways, man. Your way is out the door!</line>
    <line id="142749">Yeah?</line>
    <line id="142751">What can I get for you?</line>
    <line id="142753">Need something?</line>
    <line id="142755">Hey, hey, man.</line>
    <line id="142757">Looking for something?</line>
    <line id="142759">If you want a gunfight, you'll get one.</line>
    <line id="142761">You're starting to make me mad.</line>
    <line id="142763">If someone's gonna die today, it's not gonna be me.</line>
    <line id="142765">Don't start anything you're too scared to finish.</line>
    <line id="142767">Who's better with a gun, me or you? Wanna find out?</line>
    <line id="142769">Ugh, ain't nobody got time for this.</line>
    <line id="142771">You ever been robbed? It sucks, it really sucks!</line>
    <line id="142773">You look like you want to shoot me, man. Please, don't shoot me.</line>
    <line id="142775">I'll do whatever you want!</line>
    <line id="142777">You're freaking me out, man! I'm freaking out!</line>
    <line id="142779">Never mind!</line>
    <line id="142781">Whoa! Can you blame me for trying?</line>
    <line id="142783">That was an accident. Won't happen again!</line>
    <line id="142785">Sorry!</line>
    <line id="142787">Oh shit!</line>
    <line id="142789">Looks like the hunter is now the hunted.</line>
    <line id="142791">Couple minutes from now, your ass is gonna be grass. Have a nice day!</line>
    <line id="142793">You like cops? Well you're about to meet some soon.</line>
    <line id="142795">Two words: you're screwed.</line>
    <line id="142797">Just called 911. It's that easy when you're behind the counter.</line>
    <line id="142799">Excellent buy.</line>
    <line id="142801">Now, that's a good get.</line>
    <line id="142803">Ah thanks for the purchase.</line>
    <line id="142805">Alright.</line>
    <line id="142807">Come back if you want anything else.</line>
    <line id="142809">I'm taking some heat here, man.</line>
    <line id="142810">Keep 'em off me!</line>
    <line id="142811">I need another minute! I need another minute!</line>
    <line id="142812">Just about there.</line>

    <line id="143023">Leave now, and I won't tell anyone I saw you!</line>
    <line id="143026">Hold them off!</line>
    <line id="143028">Damn. You see that? They took out my truck. It's like they're trying to make a point.</line>
    <line id="143030">Hey, they work. How about that?</line>
    <line id="143031">Now we're cooking with gas.</line>
    <line id="143033">You better kick it up a notch.</line>
    <line id="143034">They're closing in on me.</line>
    <line id="143035">You gotta get here before they do.</line>
    <line id="143037">Right. Listen up, they're turning the place over looking for me.</line>
    <line id="143038">I'm laying low.</line>
    <line id="143039">I hope you're better with a gun than these guys are.</line>

    <line id="143048">Look, I don't want any trouble. Just get out.</line>
    <line id="143050">Whoa, man, it's you! You'd better get out of here!</line>
    <line id="143052">I'm denying you service.</line>
    <line id="143054">Go! Get lost!</line>
    <line id="143056">I don't want anything to do with you. Leave now.</line>
    <line id="143058">Maybe another time.</line>
    <line id="143060">Thanks, anyway.</line>
    <line id="143062">Hmm.</line>
    <line id="143064">Okay.</line>
    <line id="143066">That's a shame.</line>
    <line id="143068">I'm gonna start shooting if you don't go!</line>
    <line id="143070">Maybe you'll walk out of here in one piece. Maybe you won't.</line>
    <line id="143072">This is a big mistake. Go while you still can.</line>
    <line id="143074">Leave now, I'm warning you.</line>
    <line id="143076">I've got a gun, too, you know!</line>
    <line id="143078">So long!</line>
    <line id="143080">Thanks for stopping by!</line>
    <line id="143082">Alright, then.</line>
    <line id="143084">Thank you!</line>
    <line id="143086">Come again, we're open seven days a week!</line>
    <line id="143088">I'm no hero. I won't try to stop you.</line>
    <line id="143090">Don't hurt me!</line>
    <line id="143092">I don't want to die!</line>
    <line id="143094">Please, I've got kids!</line>
    <line id="143096">Let me live! I'll do anything!</line>
    <line id="143098">That silent alarm just paid for itself. Run!</line>
    <line id="143100">The police will be here soon, and they will take you down.</line>
    <line id="143102">You'll be in cuffs if you don't take off!</line>
    <line id="143104">The boys in blue are on their way.</line>
    <line id="143106">Let's see how the cops will deal with you.</line>
    <line id="143108">I'm going to pretend I didn't see you, but you need to go now.</line>
    <line id="143110">This is too much. I can't handle this. Get out.</line>
    <line id="143112">I refuse to serve the likes of you.</line>
    <line id="143114">Get lost!</line>
    <line id="143116">It's you! If you don't get out, I'll throw you out!</line>
    <line id="143118">Need a hand?</line>
    <line id="143120">You look like you could use some help.</line>
    <line id="143122">Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.</line>
    <line id="143124">I'm here if you need anything.</line>
    <line id="143126">Looking for something in particular?</line>
    <line id="143128">Shit!</line>
    <line id="143130">No!</line>
    <line id="143132">Sorry!</line>

    <line id="143175">What do you want from me?!</line>
    <line id="143177">Please, I've got a family!</line>
    <line id="143179">You want a piece of me? You're gonna get it.</line>
    <line id="143181">Round here, a man's got to learn to protect himself. Do you understand what I'm saying, son?</line>
    <line id="143183">You might have your gun on me, but I'm a quick draw, mister.</line>
    <line id="143185">This is your last chance. Go away!</line>
    <line id="143187">Get out before I shoot you to Kingdom Come!</line>

    <line id="143607">I'm telling everyone. Don't you think I should tell everyone? They have a right to know. I'm right, aren't I?</line>
    <line id="143608">Yeah. I guess you better tell.</line>
    <line id="143631">If you ask me, too many people have access to the air. Personal drones? What? Fucking insane. Dudes in basements across the country making personal robots and things that go into space or whatever.</line>
    <line id="143632">Very true.</line>
    <line id="143633">They need to arrest the shit out of them. Sir, you're a crazy wank. We're locking you up. What is going on in a dude's head makes him want to build a drone robot?</line>

    <line id="143650">Dude. I'm serious. I saw him. Mask and shit. He was trying to be all anonymous ninja. But I saw him.</line>
    <line id="143651">Everybody thinks they've seen him.</line>
    <line id="143652">This is for real. Vigilante shit. Outside my building. My place of business. Bike messenger nearly had a conniption.</line>
    <line id="143653">And why was he there?</line>
    <line id="143654">I don't know why, man? Think I asked him? Hey, vigilante dude, here's five bucks go beat up my asshole boss. Oh wow. Hey, you think he works for hire?</line>
    <line id="143678">First he fed on your lunch. Now he's feeding on your soul.</line>

    <line id="143682">Relax. Sooner or later, he'll get his. Maybe sooner than you think. Like, maybe when he leaves at lunch time and I slip onto his computer. You know, people really should log out when they walk away from their desk.</line>
    <line id="143683">I will buy you a car if you do.</line>
    <line id="143713">You said, you only had a half day today though? Are they making you stay longer?</line>

    <line id="143790">I didn't vote for him.</line>
    <line id="143791">Yeah I would've smacked you if you did. As far as I know, nobody did. And yet, here we are. Stuck with the asshole. He couldn't be a mayor in bum-fuck town.</line>

    <line id="143842">Uhh. Fine. Physically she's fine. But, well I'm kind of concerned about her mind. She's really obsessing over it.</line>
    <line id="143843">It's been a long time.</line>
    <line id="143844">Sure. She's been through a lot. I don't know if I can keep going, though. I don't know how to tell her.</line>

    <line id="143857">I guess so. But maybe you're overreacting. She was drunk. And it wasn't like you knew what you were doing either. Who cares in this day and age?</line>

    <line id="145379">No. She's too little--and too trusting. She's like a little duckling that latches onto whatever is moving and follows along.

    <line id="145433">No. You put a price in the classified because you wanted to sell it at that price. That is the price he will pay you. He really wants this car, you understand? He belongs to a certain Club.</line>

    <line id="145551">He hit him with the gun. He didn't shoot the dude. He used the gun and hit him. That ain't the same thing. That ain't five years worth.</line>
    <line id="145552">It's fucking hilarious. Old fuck had it coming. He cut the driver off.</line>
    <line id="145553">So!</line>
    <line id="145554">Relax. It wasn't like he was beating up an old man. He kicked him. The old man tried to hit him with a cane. So it's fair.</line>
    <line id="145555">All by herself. She was scared shitless. She doesn't have her own phone. I hate myself. David said we needed to get her a phone. But I didn't think she needed one and they're so pricey.</line>
    <line id="145556">Did you get her one?</line>
    <line id="145557">They don't really make special needs phones. Nothing that she can use easily with her condition. They're so expensive.</line>

    <line id="146261">I'm sorry.</line>
    <line id="146262">Ugh. Hockey.</line>
    <line id="146263">Really easily.</line>
    <line id="146264">Aww. Try harder.</line>
    <line id="146295">I'm so sorry.</line>
    <line id="146296">Did the driver even see her?</line>
    <line id="146297">I'm really sorry.</line>
    <line id="146315">Please. Do it for me, okay?</line>
    <line id="146316">No. I can't stand this. Why do I have to?</line>
    <line id="146317">For me.</line>
    <line id="146318">Ugh. I hate being nice to people. They're all assholes. They wear me out.</line>
    <line id="146323">It isn't a competition.</line>
    <line id="146324">Are you kidding me? Of course it's a fucking competition. Who does she think she is? She isn't better than me. I'm the one who found it first.</line>
    <line id="146325">I think this is getting out of control.</line>
    <line id="146326">Out of control? Are you saying that I'm outta control?</line>
    <line id="146339">What happened?</line>
    <line id="146340">I'm an idiot. That's what happened. Listen to this, I'm at the gym.</line>
    <line id="146341">Oh yeah! Your shiny new membership.</line>
    <line id="146342">Ugh. I can't ever go back. I can't ever show my face there again.</line>
    <line id="146343">What did you do?</line>
    <line id="146344">I tripped on the elliptical machine. Jammed my ankle, the machine fell over on some hot blonde chick. Broke my music player.</line>
    <line id="146360">Did he think I wouldn't check? Fake name. A wife! He's a pack of lies!</line>
    <line id="146361">At least you found out.</line>
    <line id="146362">He's a pig. You should read the shit he has on his site.</line>
    <line id="146363">Can't you leave it?</line>
    <line id="146380">Does it cost a lot?</line>
    <line id="146381">Hell ya, it costs. The entry fee is only two hundred. But the dresses, make-up, choreography -</line>
    <line id="146382">What does she need that for? She's six.</line>
    <line id="146383">She's gotta learn to dance. She ain't gonna win the big prize if she don't. Baby's gotta be good to make momma rich.</line>
    <line id="146400">Man, you're an asshole.</line>
    <line id="146401">How does that make me an asshole? It's true. Tell me you wouldn't think the same thing.</line>
    <line id="146402">I guarantee I wouldn't think the same thing.</line>
    <line id="146403">Even she admitted that being on her period ruined the weekend. Just because I agreed, doesn't make me an asshole.</line>
    <line id="146406">Call the police.</line>
    <line id="146407">We did call the police. It's getting so they know us. It's exhausting. We can't keep going through this.</line>
    <line id="146408">I know. But what can we do?</line>
    <line id="146409">If dad keeps wandering off they might have to strap him in at night? Is that terrible? God, sometimes I wish euthanasia was legal.</line>
    <line id="146410">Okay, you're not thinking straight.</line>
    <line id="146411">How's it going?</line>
    <line id="146412">The usual, gang's capping each other, hopped up hookers and some fucking vigilante who thinks he's a hero.</line>
    <line id="146413">I saw that on the news. You guys have any leads?</line>
    <line id="146414">Leads. Give me a break. This ain't a cop show. We get a call, we go out and that's that.</line>
    <line id="146415">I couldn't be a cop. Don't know how you do it.</line>
    <line id="146416">Yeah. I don't know why I do it either.</line>
    <line id="146417">I don't have any money.</line>
    <line id="146418">But this is a good deal. It's a steal.</line>
    <line id="146419">A steal from me.</line>
    <line id="146420">What's that supposed to mean? I was only asking for a loan. I'm not trying to steal from you. Why are you such an asshole?</line>
    <line id="146428">Uh. Yeah, yeah.</line>
    <line id="146429">Don't yeah-yeah, me. You eat like shit. We agreed we do this together. You probably bought donuts for breakfast this morning?</line>
    <line id="146430">Nope. Not yet, but that's a good idea.</line>
    <line id="146431">No way. I'm on a diet. You're on a diet.</line>
    <line id="146432">Even if we're not together?</line>
    <line id="146433">That's when it matters most, dufus.</line>
    <line id="146434">Okay. I won't buy a donut.</line>
    <line id="146435">I've got your phone location. I'll know.</line>
    <line id="146437">American Sign Language Interpreter</line>
    <line id="146438">No way! That's so mean.</line>
    <line id="146439">He wasn't behaving.</line>
    <line id="146440">You left him like that and went to work? Wait. Did you use those fuzzy handcuffs on him?</line>
    <line id="146441">Yes.</line>
    <line id="146442">Your guys sex life is so entertaining for me. Next time upload it.</line>
    <line id="146443">Okay.</line>
    <line id="146444">Engineer - Civil</line>
    <line id="146445">Martial Arts Instructor</line>
    <line id="146446">Isn't me. It's him. He's the one stealing from the office. I only gave him the password.</line>
    <line id="146447">Then it's your fault too.</line>
    <line id="146448">Look, I didn't know what he was going to do before he did it. How is that my fault? He told me that he misplaced it. I'm a receptionist. He's a manager. I mean what, am I supposed to say no?</line>
    <line id="146450">Engineer - Mechanical</line>
    <line id="146451">Engineer - Computer</line>
    <line id="146452">Engineer - Petroleum</line>
    <line id="146458">Oh yeah? Men's or women's?</line>
    <line id="146459">Men's, of course.</line>
    <line id="146460">Why of course?</line>
    <line id="146461">I get caught doing that in the women's - I think I can get charged with indecency or something, right? Plus, he'd find that a little weird.</line>
    <line id="146462">Wait ... he?</line>
    <line id="146463">Fuck that. They say one night, but I've been dodging them for six years. It's a trick.</line>
    <line id="146464">I don't think they are allowed to trick you.</line>
    <line id="146465">Yeah, we'll you're naive. They trick child predators on TV every week.</line>
    <line id="146466">Not exactly the same thing...</line>
    <line id="146467">Oh yeah, he told me I was. But he said he'd already "filled his quota." And if the government was going to force him to hire "my people" over his, he'd have to do the same.</line>
    <line id="146468">Sounds like a real dick. You know what, though - you'd've had that fuck as your boss. That'd be even worse.</line>
    <line id="146469">Oh yeah, what does it feel like?</line>
    <line id="146470">Daydreaming, mostly. You just kinda drift off into your thoughts and tune out the outside world.</line>
    <line id="146471">So it's like meditating.</line>
    <line id="146472">More or less. I did sleep better. I feel rested. And I've decided to murder your wife.</line>
    <line id="146473">Haw haw.</line>
    <line id="146474">Marge says hi.</line>
    <line id="146475">Who?</line>
    <line id="146476">You met her. The one with the lisp?</line>
    <line id="146477">Tell her I thaid thalutationths.</line>
    <line id="146478">Oh... that's not funny! hahaha!</line>
    <line id="146479">People walk SO SLOWLY.</line>
    <line id="146480">why should that stop u?</line>
    <line id="146481">shove those motherfuckers.</line>
    <line id="146482">Yeah! Get out of my way, right? </line>
    <line id="146483">No! I'm just joking!</line>
    <line id="146484">Yep.</line>
    <line id="146485">Are we--</line>
    <line id="146486">Uh-huh.</line>
    <line id="146487">But that means--</line>
    <line id="146488">It does.</line>
    <line id="146489">Huh. I--</line>
    <line id="146490">I love you too.</line>
    <line id="146491">I do. Otherwise, this isn't going to work.</line>
    <line id="146492">Sex therapist. What does that even mean?</line>
    <line id="146493">She's an expert in making people more comfortable. Fixes the problems in our heads rather than with the ... equipment.</line>
    <line id="146494">And you're ok to just talk to some stranger about it?</line>
    <line id="146495">Well we're obviously not good at talking to one another, are we?</line>
    <line id="146498">Ever feel like you're being watched?</line>
    <line id="146499">No lol</line>
    <line id="146500">I do. Like, right this very second.</line>
    <line id="146501">You're paranoid</line>
    <line id="146503">Don't lie to me, bitch. I found your number in my husband's phone. I saw you with him at that club the other night.</line>
    <line id="146504">Bullshit. What about that email you sent? I've already posted your crap online. Your fucking address is out there for everyone to see.</line>
    <line id="146505">You're wrong! It's a misunderstanding.</line>
    <line id="146510">What's safe browsing?</line>
    <line id="146511">Oh, no. My friend, you need to modernize. It's no longer about finding places to hide your magazines. Everything you do is saved right on your computer.</line>
    <line id="146512">Shit. Would she know that?</line>
    <line id="146513">She works in tech support, buddy. Of course she knows that.</line>
    <line id="146514">Oh shit. Oh shit.</line>
    <line id="146520">which korea is bad north or south?</line>
    <line id="146521">south... obviosly... duh...</line>
    <line id="146522">k thx... booking a holiday... </line>
    <line id="146540">Bitch, you can't just take my kids whenever you want them.</line>
    <line id="146541">I don't care what you are. You think I don't know who called Child Services? What--you think you're gonna be their mama if you get me out of the picture?</line>
    <line id="146542">No. No! I just want what's best for them. And right now you're not what's best for them.</line>
    <line id="146543">But the categorical imperative is key to maintaining order!</line>
    <line id="146544">Wrong! Society is fueled by utilitarianism, not morality!</line>
    <line id="146545">I don't think we can be friends anymore.</line>
    <line id="146575">Have you asked her why?</line>
    <line id="146576">Yeah. She just smiles and says she wasn't crying. Even though her cheeks are still wet all every time. She keeps asking for time alone.</line>
    <line id="146577">Give her space. Let her work through it. She's probably embarrassed.</line>
    <line id="146578">Well, she just needs to grow the fuck up.</line>
    <line id="146579">Forget it. It's you that needs to apologize.</line>
    <line id="146580">Why did you even call me?</line>
    <line id="146581">I need some money.</line>
    <line id="146582">Then earn some damn money! How's that my problem?</line>
    <line id="146583">I need bail money.</line>
    <line id="146584">Uh, no you didn't. Uh-uh, no way.</line>
    <line id="146585">I had a friend who used to make movies.</line>
    <line id="146586">there was a producer who would show up</line>
    <line id="146587">constantly get in the way.</line>
    <line id="146588">so they had a budget under ‘ancillaries'</line>
    <line id="146589">How was the guitar lesson?</line>
    <line id="146590">My fingers are killing me!</line>
    <line id="146591">Oh yeah. That'll go away.</line>
    <line id="146592">I want to gnaw my fingertips off, they hurt so bad!!!</line>
    <line id="146593">Nope. And it turn out he's actually been married twice before me. But that's not the worst part. He's got a son.</line>
    <line id="146594">Well, how do you know it's true?</line>
    <line id="146595">I paid an internet detective to do some digging. These were public records. He changed his name, but that's on record, too.</line>
    <line id="146596">So sorry, girl. How much did it cost you?</line>
    <line id="146597">$750. That's all it costs to destroy your life.</line>
    <line id="146599">Are you home? I wanna pick up some stuff.</line>
    <line id="146600">Yeah, but I can leave.</line>
    <line id="146601">Please do. I can't see you right now.</line>
    <line id="146602">K</line>
    <line id="146603">Dumbass is tracking himself. He's got a little meter that clips onto his pants. Fitness monitor.</line>
    <line id="146604">Oh, smart!</line>
    <line id="146605">It takes about 2,000 steps for him to get to work. 4,000 if I count the walk back. He answers phones all day, sitting at his desk. Now explain to me how he's coming back with 14,000 steps a day.</line>
    <line id="146606">Damn. I can't, but he's lying about something.</line>
    <line id="146607">Your sponsor called.</line>
    <line id="146608">Oh shit.</line>
    <line id="146609">Are you fucking kidding me?!</line>
    <line id="146610">It was ONE time!</line>
    <line id="146611">Last chance! Stay clean or I'm gone!</line>
    <line id="146615">She eats pickles and lard all day!</line>
    <line id="146616">Nasty!</line>
    <line id="146617">She says it's what the baby wants. :s</line>
    <line id="146618">What kind of mutant baby wants pickles and lard?</line>
    <line id="146619">Can't wait for this thing to pop out.</line>
    <line id="146622">yo, sandy came over last night!</line>
    <line id="146623">sloppy seconds. go nuts.</line>
    <line id="146624">wasn't nothing sloppy about what we did!</line>
    <line id="146625">if you're trying to make me jealous, it won't work.</line>
    <line id="146626">not my fault you can't satisfy!</line>
    <line id="146630">Yeah, me neither. Not unless they can play an instrument or something. At least try to earn your damn money. You don't see me with my hand out.</line>
    <line id="146631">I saw one of them just taking a piss right in the corner of the train platform with people all around. Didn't even care.</line>
    <line id="146632">Yeah. If they don't care, I don't care.</line>
    <line id="146633">You're going to have to make time. If I leave, I'm fired. They're just waiting for an excuse.</line>
    <line id="146634">I told you I am done with that. Done. I'm not getting arrested for you.</line>
    <line id="146635">I don't hear you complaining when I take you out. What are you wearing today? I bet I bought this shit.</line>
    <line id="146636">OBJECTIVE</line>

    <line id="146645">I saw one of those talking moose heads today</line>
    <line id="146646">nearly beat the shit out of it.</line>
    <line id="146647">What?!  </line>
    <line id="146650">Life often feels like a bunch of obstacles meant just for me.</line>
    <line id="146651">School, work, family. None brought me any true happiness.</line>
    <line id="146652">They've only ever held me back from being who I want to be.</line>
    <line id="146653">You know what I'm saying?</line>
    <line id="146654">I'm so embarrassed. I've never worn heels so darned high. And there I was falling flat on my face.</line>
    <line id="146655">We were heading downtown to the theater. It was busy, all these fancy cars and people. Even Lucky Quinn was in the audience.</line>
    <line id="146656">Am I supposed to know him?</line>
    <line id="146657">You don't know him? He's notorious. Ugly as sin. And anyway-</line>
    <line id="146658">sorry man waaaay too baked to handle all your shit today.</line>
    <line id="146659">That's half of what I paid. Was it a digital copy?</line>
    <line id="146660">That doesn't make a lick of sense! It's the same damn company.</line>
    <line id="146661">Yeah but you're paying for their property rental ... the extra employees ... that hip little coffee shop in the front.</line>
    <line id="146662">Ugh.</line>
    <line id="146663">You can do it! Come on, say it!</line>
    <line id="146664">I can do it! I can do it! I ... can't do it.</line>
    <line id="146665">Have you been listening the tracks I sent you?</line>

    <line id="146702">hi dad, enjoying the new phone?</line>
    <line id="146703">This is your dad.</line>
    <line id="146704">yes. I can see that.</line>
    <line id="146710">You hacked the target</line>

    <line id="146714">No thanks.</line>
    <line id="146716">Hack complete.</line>
    <line id="146717">You killed the target</line>

    <line id="146720">I'm serious!</line>
    <line id="146721">I can see it in her eyes.</line>
    <line id="146722">You said you were going to chip in!!!</line>
    <line id="146723">Yes. WHEN I have the dough</line>
    <line id="146724">Read the WHOLE note</line>
    <line id="146726">Those beady creepy little eyes.</line>
    <line id="146727">I've seen some nasty stuff on there. This lady's cat was so used to living in her toxic home when they freed him, he took one breath of fresh air and his heart stopped.</line>
    <line id="146728">Awww. Poor thing. I mean, I have my collections. My salt and pepper shakers. My owl sculptures. I can see how they can get a little crazy.</line>
    <line id="146729">This woman collected feces. She had a mountain of it.</line>
    <line id="146730">Oh, god.</line>
    <line id="146731">It is. They pulled the broken tooth, but they've only given me two options. They can drill an implant into my jaw to hold the new tooth, which probably means a bone graft to make sure it holds, or they can file down two of my good teeth to create a bridge.</line>
    <line id="146732">Why are you worrying about that now?</line>
    <line id="146733">Because they're both terrible options.</line>
    <line id="146734">You should be focused on getting away from him.</line>
    <line id="146735">How are you doing, sweetie?</line>
    <line id="146736">I wish I could crawl under a rock and just die!</line>
    <line id="146737">Be there soon. Bringing ice cream and movies.</line>
    <line id="146742">Impromptu sleepover!</line>
    <line id="146743">What would I do without you? :)</line>
    <line id="146744">Had a great time last night. Hook up again?</line>
    <line id="146745">Eww no!</line>
    <line id="146746">What the hell?</line>
    <line id="146747">Your thing smells like spoiled milk.</line>
    <line id="146749">You missed an awesome night.</line>
    <line id="146750">Good bar?</line>
    <line id="146751">There was this tiny girl. HOT.</line>
    <line id="146753">When I found out who fucking told them. Are you sure you don't have an idea who it was?</line>
    <line id="146754">You didn't see my email? The one I forwarded you?</line>
    <line id="146755">Whatever. Somebody kindly told the tax assholes about my side business. Not only did they fucking fine me three thousand dollars, they put a lock on my fucking garage. My garage!</line>
    <line id="146756">Yes. It's horrible! There's only you, Winona and Lucy who knew.</line>
    <line id="146757">I don't know. Something just snapped. He threw his keyboard. Then his monitor. Kicked over a printer. He even kicked the poor secretary's chair and she rolled into the wall. She'll probably charge him with assault.</line>
    <line id="146758">Did anybody stop him?</line>
    <line id="146759">Security guards tazed his ass. I got it on my phone. I'll send it to you.</line>
    <line id="146760">Assassin.</line>
    <line id="146761">Henry Ford.</line>
    <line id="146762">Templar.</line>

    <line id="146768">Hermeticist.</line>
    <line id="146769">The whole damn window smashed. You know where the booths are? So they got in that way and then spray painted the chairs, walls. The bathroom was flooded.</line>
    <line id="146770">It was gonna be a nice diner. Nothing fancy. Right? Like I told you.</line>
    <line id="146771">It's sad. Right? They're picking on their own. Why they gotta trash us? We weren't nothing fancy. A neighborhood joint.</line>
    <line id="146772">How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?</line>
    <line id="146773">I don't know.</line>
    <line id="146777">watch yourself or imma cut you</line>

    <line id="146781">wait... shit. wrong contact</line>
    <line id="146782">This is embarrassing..</line>
    <line id="146783">Don't say it like someone shat in your mouth. Give me a break! How can you live in Chicago and not like hockey?</line>
    <line id="146784">We have nothing to talk about now. Ever.</line>
    <line id="146785">I told you where I'm staying this weekend, right?</line>
    <line id="146786">3 times.</line>
    <line id="146787">Sry. It's this girl I'm dating.</line>
    <line id="146788">Crazy one?</line>
    <line id="146789">Says she wants to know what it feels like</line>
    <line id="146790">I think I'm lactose intolerant.</line>
    <line id="146791">Really, why?</line>
    <line id="146792">I had a milkshake and it was like my ass sneezed.</line>

    <line id="146846">What? No. That's not true.</line>
    <line id="146847">It isn't?</line>
    <line id="146848">Well it is, but that never stopped me from getting sleep before.</line>
    <line id="146849">You said no friends. He's not a friend--he's the father of my child.</line>
    <line id="146850">I don't care who he is. Your life outside my walls are your business. Inside, you follow my rules or I'll turn you in to the police. Lord knows I have plenty to tell them about you.</line>
    <line id="146851">All it takes is one bad cop in the news and they all become targets for the protesters. I understand why they get angry, but they focus it on the ones who only want to keep the peace.</line>
    <line id="146852">Did he get hurt?</line>
    <line id="146853">Just a few bruises. They give him the riot shield and helmet. And those guys are like a roman phalanx when they're all suited up.</line>
    <line id="146915">So how much did he take?</line>
    <line id="146916">What do you mean you saw him?</line>
    <line id="146919">Now don't say anything else, just listen. Give me a chance to make my case.</line>
    <line id="146920">How long have you known?</line>
    <line id="146922">What makes you think so?</line>
    <line id="146923">He refuses to read books. Says they're boring.</line>
    <line id="146924">Goth?</line>
    <line id="146925">Thirty bucks, but it's not the money. It's the scam. I feel so stupid for falling for it.</line>
    <line id="146926">This is the guy outside your loft?</line>
    <line id="146927">Yeah, the one with the cups.</line>
    <line id="146928">You know what, we'll go together later and threaten him with the cops if he doesn't give it back.</line>
    <line id="146929">I don't think that's a good idea. Have you see the tattoos on his face? I think you get those in prison for killing somebody.</line>
    <line id="146930">It's not the first time. Last night he was across the street in his car. He saw me and drove off.</line>
    <line id="146931">Honey, that's impossible. He's dead.</line>
    <line id="146932">I know that. I know. But I saw him. Jesus, am I losing my mind?</line>
    <line id="146933">No. Don't think that. Maybe somebody's playing a cruel prank.</line>
    <line id="146940">Okay, go.</line>
    <line id="146941">Okay. Okay. Here goes. Listen, I know I'm not somebody that somebody like you would ... I mean, I know I've got a reputation. But you and me ... I think we could be something good. I think we both need to stop wasting time with the wrong people and give it a shot. I don't need an answer from you right now. I just want you to think about it...</line>
    <line id="146942">He just found out yesterday.</line>
    <line id="146943">How long until he goes?</line>
    <line id="146944">I've still got him for a month, so we'll make the most of our time together.</line>
    <line id="146945">Relax. You know--he'll do his tour and he'll come back fine.</line>
    <line id="146950">Cuz. they be wearing the costumes, you know--them robes. And they got them long beards. The mans be holding hands when they walk ... and I've only seen they wives once or twice. And they faces are fully covered.</line>
    <line id="146951">So ... they're traditional.</line>
    <line id="146952">I don't know. What you think? Should I call homeland security or something?</line>
    <line id="146953">Report them for what?</line>
    <line id="146954">Okay, explain it to me again.</line>
    <line id="146955">It's not a hard concept. The term "reverse racism" is racist or at least ethnocentric.</line>
    <line id="146956">How so?</line>
    <line id="146957">Because it assumes only white people can be racist. Anyone can be racist. If someone is racist, they're just a racist. Doesn't matter where they're from, a racist is a racist. Not a reverse-racist.</line>
    <line id="146958">I don't know why I keep dating. I hate it. Dating sucks. I hate trying to make nice with random strangers.</line>
    <line id="146959">God, I'd be so annoyed with you right now if that wasn't true.</line>
    <line id="146960">You keep doing it because you're horny.</line>
    <line id="146961">Look, everyone goes through this. The goal is to meet someone you can be with long term so you don't have to date anymore. No one actually likes dating!</line>
    <line id="146962">So, about the other night.</line>
    <line id="146963">But I think we should.</line>
    <line id="146964">What is there to say? You got drunk, you kissed me. We went back to my place, one thing led to another.</line>
    <line id="146965">Look, I'm not gay.</line>
    <line id="146966">Okay.</line>
    <line id="146967">Okay. I mean. Shit. Am I gay?</line>
    <line id="146968">So my dad asks me, "Do you still have that pellet gun?" I ask him why and he says, "I need it to get rid of a raccoon."</line>
    <line id="146969">Are you serious?</line>
    <line id="146970">Completely serious. I tell him that raccoons are tough little buggers. A pellet gun would only piss one off. So then he asks me, "What if I used the 9 millimeter?"</line>
    <line id="146971">Oh my god.</line>
    <line id="146972">So, that's why I tell him that, yes, a 9mm would kill a raccoon, but it's illegal to fire a gun in city limits. So then he says, "Right, right, I got it...so where can I buy a silencer?"</line>
    <line id="146973">No way.</line>
    <line id="146978">Oh yeah, I got into fights all the time as a kid.</line>
    <line id="146979">Man, I can't imagine you in a fight.</line>
    <line id="146980">Hey, a lot changes between a person's teen years and adulthood.</line>
    <line id="146981">Still, you're so chill now.</line>
    <line id="146982">You know, I once even put a big survival knife to some poor kid's throat. Man, I had issues. He was pissed.</line>
    <line id="146983">Jesus Christ man!</line>
    <line id="146984">No, I'm not going to tell you.</line>
    <line id="146985">C'mon, I told you my most embarrassing sex story!</line>
    <line id="146986">No way.</line>
    <line id="146987">Okay, but you can't tell anyone.</line>
    <line id="146988">Alright, well, this one time, well, I asked a girl to wrap her hair around my dick and jerk me off.</line>
    <line id="146989">Yeah, he pulled me over and told me that I was speeding.</line>
    <line id="146990">So what'd you say?</line>
    <line id="146991">I was honest. I said, "Officer, I know I was speeding, but I've gotta take a piss so bad that if I don't do it soon I'm going to ruin this leather car seat."</line>
    <line id="146992">No way.</line>
    <line id="146993">Not only did I get out of the ticket, but he also had me follow him to the nearest restroom.</line>
    <line id="146994">No way! Man, I should try that the next time I get pulled over.</line>
    <line id="146995">You say I owe sixteen hundred dollars in medical bills but how do I know that you're legit?</line>
    <line id="146996">I already told you, I represent a collection agency hired by the hospital to collect your unpaid medical bills. I can give you a number to call if that'll help.</line>
    <line id="146997">And how do I know that won't be a fake number? This could all be a scam.</line>
    <line id="146998">I assure you sir, this is serious. How about I give you an address so you can come by and pay the bill in person?</line>
    <line id="146999">So, what do I need to bring.</line>
    <line id="147000">We'll provide the weapons, but you need to bring your own ammo.</line>
    <line id="147001">Okay.</line>
    <line id="147002">Just to be clear, these are minimum numbers.</line>
    <line id="147003">Right.</line>
    <line id="147004">So you'll need five hundred rounds of forty-five A-C-P, full metal jacket. Three hundred rounds of five five six, also F-M-J, and one hundred and fifty twelve gauge shotgun shells. And make sure they're double-aught buckshot.</line>
    <line id="147005">That's the minimum? Jesus, this is going to be one hell of a weekend.</line>
    <line id="147007">I really screwed up the recipe. I don't think I can save it.</line>
    <line id="147008">What did you do?</line>
    <line id="147009">I used rice vinegar when the recipe said to use rice wine.</line>
    <line id="147010">How did that happen?</line>
    <line id="147011">The bottles are labeled in Chinese! And they were right next to each other!</line>
    <line id="147012">Is it even edible?</line>
    <line id="147013">One sec...  Actually...it's not too bad.</line>
    <line id="147014">Save some for when I get home.</line>
    <line id="147015">Doesn't surprise me, man. </line>
    <line id="147016">I'm serious. If it's not on the TV, he doesn't have the imagination to put it together for himself.</line>
    <line id="147017">What about children's books?</line>
    <line id="147018">You know what ... I think I know what I'm getting him for Christmas.</line>
    <line id="147019">Yeah. Black hair, black nails, black makeup, black clothes, black purse, yellow car.</line>
    <line id="147020"> You didn't!</line>
    <line id="147021">Yes I did. Canary yellow. If she wants to paint it black, she's going to have to save up for it.</line>
    <line id="147022"> You didn't!</line>
    <line id="147023">Oh I did. And she's got a job offer at Callie's, where she'll have a lovely pink uniform. </line>
    <line id="147024">It's the same anywhere. Pawnee's just more spread out.</line>
    <line id="147025">That's enough for me. Out of sight, out of mind.</line>
    <line id="147026">Just make sure you're keeping your door locked at night.</line>
    <line id="147027">I told her she's gotta get clean or get somebody else.</line>
    <line id="147028">She's got the motivation. She's got a support group. She really wants it .... but no, I don't believe she can do it. I'm giving her one more chance to prove me wrong.</line>
    <line id="147029">Yeah and once that stuff is online ... it's always online. Was it a good picture at least?</line>
    <line id="147030">What? No ... I don't know. You're not going to look for it, are you?</line>
    <line id="147031">I know, honey.</line>
    <line id="147032">A what?</line>
    <line id="147033">Some kind of ninja sword. He collected them, so they made an example out of him with his own sword. Took off his hands and feet, and then his ... you know.</line>
    <line id="147034">Oh gross. Was this gang related?</line>
    <line id="147035">They think so. Of course it could have been his girlfriend. I've seen him out with other women on his arm.</line>
    <line id="147036"> No, I guess I don't.</line>
    <line id="147037">I figure if it came down to it, I could use my tornado shelter.</line>
    <line id="147038">Underground? Near a cemetery?</line>
    <line id="147039">Ooh. I see what you're saying - what if instead of rising from their graves...</line>
    <line id="147040">They move laterally. Yeah. And then you're trapped in there with them.</line>
    <line id="147043">No. I mean, I don't know how to do that maneuver, so I didn't want to hurt him, but surely somebody in that mall knew what to do.</line>
    <line id="147044">Did they at least call 911?</line>
    <line id="147045">I did, yeah. Everybody else was snapping pictures or taking video with their phones. There are already two videos shared on the web, the news linked to them.</line>
    <line id="147046">Well that was dumb. The stations pay well for footage like that. You don't give it out for free.</line>
    <line id="147047">Ugh. It's just so annoying.</line>
    <line id="147048">Hey, look, we don't need to talk about it, okay?</line>
    <line id="147049">Oh man!</line>
    <line id="147050">Hate gyms. Gonna stay fat. Forever.</line>
    <line id="147051">I wonder where that guy is nowadays. He probably still thinks I'm some sort of psycho.</line>
    <line id="147052">It still feels weird. I was drunk and I didn't mean to--</line>
    <line id="147053">Hey, how many times are you going to apologize? No harm done. I promise.</line>
    <line id="147054">The last time I came over, she wouldn't even look at me.</line>
    <line id="147055">I just wanna say one thing.</line>
    <line id="147056">Shut up.</line>
    <line id="147057">Give me a chance to talk.</line>
    <line id="147058">Shut. Up. Shut up. Shut up.</line>
    <line id="147059">He was there after hours, only a couple people in the whole building. He went to another floor to get a coffee and the power went out while he was in the elevator.</line>
    <line id="147060">Uh oh.</line>
    <line id="147061">The generators failed, too. So it was pitch black. He panicked, had an asthma attack. His inhaler was upstairs on his desk.</line>
    <line id="147062">She can't be here when my wife gets home. She's passed out. Still completely drunk. I have no idea where she even lives and I can't just dump her on the street.</line>
    <line id="147063">Did you slip her a mickey?</line>
    <line id="147064">No! It was just a harmless poker night. One of the guys brought her. We all got a little sloshed, and he must have left her behind.</line>
    <line id="147068">Please!</line>
    <line id="147069">I swear.</line>
    <line id="147070">No!</line>
    <line id="147071">Oh it gets worse. While she does it a bit of her hair manages to get stuck in my zipper, and I mean really stuck. So when I came I kinda jerked and I...well, I ripped out a little bit of her hair.</line>
    <line id="147072">Oh my god that is hilarious and awful!</line>
    <line id="147076">Leave it? I'm meeting his wife for lunch.</line>
    <line id="147077">Married?</line>
    <line id="147078">No. I think he's never been with a woman before.</line>
    <line id="147079">What? He's 27 and he's adorable. I don't buy that. Plus he's always posting about all the action he gets.</line>
    <line id="147080">Yeah, right.</line>
    <line id="147081">Oh. Oh... You know what. Now he's even more adorable.</line>
    <line id="147082">Yeah, I think you're up for the job. All you have to do is take one of the targets. Let me take the hot one, you just get in there and distract the friend while I work my magic.</line>
    <line id="147083">What if I'm not into her?</line>
    <line id="147084">Not a requirement, pal. You're going to throw her back in as soon as I have my fish hooked. Unless you find a keeper, too.</line>
    <line id="147085">No! You dog!</line>
    <line id="147086">You don't understand how it works. You don't have any control over friction.</line>
    <line id="147087">Uh huh. And if the hygienist had been a man?</line>
    <line id="147088">Well that's different. If it's a man and there's friction, it retreats. </line>
    <line id="147089">Orange. For heavy flow.</line>
    <line id="147090">Oh, come on. They go by flow?</line>
    <line id="147091">Of course, why else would they need a color system?</line>
    <line id="147092">I dunno, size? Why can't you do this?</line>
    <line id="147094">Yeah. They're going to make me pee in a cup. Do you know what they look for?</line>
    <line id="147095">Drugs, of course.</line>
    <line id="147096">Like ... drugs drugs or Marijuana?</line>
    <line id="147097">Marijuana is a drug. Have you smoked a joint this week?</line>
    <line id="147098">Uhm. I've got one lit right now.</line>
    <line id="147099">Listen, you need to call them and make them postpone the test.</line>
    <line id="147100">Oh yeah, like that's safe. Me walking into some strange place, alone.</line>
    <line id="147101">Sir, it wouldn't be a strange place. It's an office building. This is on the level.</line>
    <line id="147102">Um. You don't say that over the phone, stupid. Somebody could be listening.</line>
    <line id="147103">Yeah. Somebody's been watching too much TV.</line>
    <line id="147104">Hey you can be stupid all you want, but I'm not going to be a part of it. Maybe it'll teach you to pick an easier pin number.</line>
    <line id="147105">I got in!</line>
    <line id="147106">That's fantastic! Now can you get me in?</line>
    <line id="147107">No ... I mean, after a year I can do a recommendation, but I can't just--</line>
    <line id="147108">Hey! You owe me!</line>
    <line id="147109">Oh - is that why you helped me? I thought it was because we were friends.</line>
    <line id="147110">Wait, did you say semen? As in, well, semen?</line>
    <line id="147111">Yeah, that's what the plumber said. It was gumming up the works. Apparently the system was never designed to handle spunk.</line>
    <line id="147112">Ugh, that's...ugh.</line>
    <line id="147113">Tell me about it. I've never been so happy about not being a plumber in my life. Next time I bitch about my job, just remind me about the poor bastard and the semen-filled drains.</line>
    <line id="147114">He was the smartest out of all of us. Remember when he strapped some model rocket engines onto the top of his RC car?</line>
    <line id="147115">Oh man, that thing went flying! We learned the hard way that you can't turn an RC car when it's going that fast.</line>
    <line id="147116">Or how about that one time when you accidentally shot him in the leg with a BB gun?</line>
    <line id="147117">Hey! I checked! I was sure it was empty! I don't know how that BB got in there. I shook it and nothing rattleed.</line>
    <line id="147118">Shit man, I miss that guy.</line>
    <line id="147126">I'm telling you, the kid is not my son.</line>
    <line id="147127">But she says that you're the one.</line>
    <line id="147128">I only slept with her once without protection. And it was at her urging.</line>
    <line id="147129">Once is enough.</line>
    <line id="147130">But that was two days ago! There's no way she'd know she was pregnant already. Do you have any idea how that works?</line>
    <line id="147131">Sure I, actually, I never really thought about it. They can't just know right away?</line>
    <line id="147139">Okay, here goes.</line>
    <line id="147140">Just say it.</line>
    <line id="147141">I love you, I have for a while now. I realized this when I got my cat.</line>
    <line id="147142">Your cat?</line>
    <line id="147143">Hear me out, when I'm cuddling with my cat it's like, my...bear with me...my soul is being recharged. It's like, everything that wears me out during the day slowly gets healed.</line>
    <line id="147144">Uh-huh...</line>
    <line id="147145">I know, it's, god I'm so bad at this but I'm just gonna barrel ahead. It's like, a slow trickle charge. But when I'm with you, when you touch me, it's like that times a million. It's like, I get refreshed every time I'm with you.</line>
    <line id="147146">So I'm a power outlet...</line>
    <line id="147147">Yes! No! I mean...</line>
    <line id="147148">I'm like your cat. A pet.</line>
    <line id="147156">Parents are the problem. Once they have kids they all go nuts.</line>
    <line id="147157">Please stop talking.</line>
    <line id="147158">Seriously. All rational thought goes out of their minds. It's the "won't somebody think of the children!" syndrome. It's ridiculous.</line>
    <line id="147159">Wait till you have kids.</line>
    <line id="147160">Just the other day a friend of mine bought a five hundred dollar stroller. Five hundred dollars! He said he knew it was ridiculous, but he felt he had to get the best for his kid. The man's got fifty two grand in credit card debt!</line>
    <line id="147169">No, they didn't have any left so I ordered a dozen Boston creams.</line>
    <line id="147170">What?</line>
    <line id="147171">They didn't have any jelly doughnuts left.</line>
    <line id="147172">So you got Boston cream instead? How the fuck is that the same!</line>
    <line id="147173">Well, it's filled with something.</line>
    <line id="147174">You incompetent fuck! You worthless piece of shit! You better not come back here without jelly doughnuts or I'll rip your fucking lungs out of your ass with my bare hands!</line>
    <line id="147175">You know what? I've had it with you treating me like shit. When I get back I'm going to kick your ass because you've had it coming.</line>
    <line id="147176">Okay, Boston cream is good.</line>
    <line id="147177">Don't do this. You're overreacting.</line>
    <line id="147178">Overreacting? You faked a pregnancy. Do you even comprehend how psychotic that is?</line>
    <line id="147179">I thought you were going to leave me.</line>
    <line id="147180">I was. And now I am.</line>
    <line id="147181">See, that's what they're expecting. You have to keep it somewhere they're not expecting. Otherwise, all they have to do is get right next to you ... on the L-Train, for example, and they can make a duplicate of your card. They don't even have to touch you.</line>
    <line id="147182">I call bullshit on that one.</line>
    <line id="147183">Call bullshit, then. But don't cry to me when your card is filled up with charges in China.</line>
    <line id="147184">I'm saying you're not who you think you are. That walk you have ... the clothes. Everybody sees right through it. You can't just have a little crisis and turn yourself into somebody different. We all see through it.</line>
    <line id="147185">Whatever.</line>
    <line id="147186">Even that. Whatever. Come on, really? You don't say stupid shit like that.</line>
    <line id="147187">I thought you did. That's why I told them there was no way it was true. It's easy to assume the aldermen are corrupt here, but I remembered he was a friend of yours.</line>
    <line id="147188">He's not a friend. It's ... complicated. Let's just say I wouldn't be too sad if they find something.</line>
    <line id="147189">Oh. Wow. I had no idea.</line>
    <line id="147190">You name it. God knows I owe you one.</line>
    <line id="147191">I have a friend who is in a bit of trouble ... mostly my fault. Nothing dangerous for you, but he needs to lay low for the weekend.</line>
    <line id="147192">What's this about?</line>
    <line id="147193">I don't want to say anything over the phone. Can you do it? Please?</line>
    <line id="147194">Ok. Ok. I'll do it.</line>
    <line id="147195">You're going to send the client list to the contact I've provided. We'll analyze it, see where it goes, and see if we have enough to convict.</line>
    <line id="147196">And if you do?</line>
    <line id="147197">You'll get the payment we promised. You can trust us. We're the government.</line>
    <line id="147198">Yeah? Well so was she.</line>
    <line id="147199">Huh you have exceeded the maximum hum, minutes this month by a significant amount, which explains the high bill. Huh, remember, messages left in your voicemail also factor into the bill and I'm showing heavy activity.</line>
    <line id="147200">Ma'am, our web page clearly indicates you can opt out of our promotional calls.</line>
    <line id="147201">Your website is always down!</line>
    <line id="147202">I give a mean massage.</line>
    <line id="147203">You'd better, for all the stress you've been causing me.</line>
    <line id="147204">I can do an erotic massage, too.</line>
    <line id="147205">Oh really?</line>
    <line id="147206">With oils.</line>
    <line id="147207">I'm listening...</line>
    <line id="147208">It's open! He's got a crew out to day to remove the spray paint, but he's already had a couple of customers.</line>
    <line id="147209">What spray paint?</line>
    <line id="147210">Some hoodlums wrote "Go back to Mexico" across the front of the restaurant. Stupid thing is, the sign says "Brazilian Steakhouse" right out front.</line>
    <line id="147212">Ok, I guess. He's been in there since he was 14 and he knows he won't get out until he's at least 40.</line>
    <line id="147213">Damn that's a long sentence for a minor. What's he in for?</line>
    <line id="147214">Originally, for possession. But once you get in there, you're in with the real gang. You do what they say. In this case, they said "stab a guard."</line>
    <line id="147215">Gone. Vanished.</line>
    <line id="147216">But they have records, don't they?</line>
    <line id="147217">They moved to digital backups, no paper. And the digital backups, going back 10 years, say I have nothing in my account. It doesn't make sense. I have some e-mail statements, but now they're looking into me for fraud.</line>
    <line id="147218">Ugh.</line>
    <line id="147219">Weirdest thing. The payphone rang, I answered it, and some weird voice was on the other end. It told me to give a message to somebody.</line>
    <line id="147220">Hey tell the guy with the hat, that they know he's listening.</line>
    <line id="147221">So, did you deliver the message?</line>
    <line id="147222">I tried, but there wasn't any guy with a hat around. It was pretty empty. I guess it was a prank. Like I said, weirdest thing.</line>
    <line id="147223">You can't do this.</line>
    <line id="147224">You guys don't need me anymore. Please. Just let me go.</line>
    <line id="147225">We can't. We can't. You're not just a--a pillar. You're the foundation. Please. Just talk to me about it.</line>
    <line id="147226">We're in the clear.</line>
    <line id="147227">Thank fucking god.</line>
    <line id="147228">Any trace of the missing crates were wiped off the system and the money transfer for the job came through this morning.</line>
    <line id="147229">This is a lifesaver. We were going to lose the house.</line>
    <line id="147230">Who says crime doesn't pay?</line>
    <line id="147236">A brother. An older brother. Never met him, didn't even know about him until yesterday. My pops was all teared up when he came clean.</line>
    <line id="147237">So are you going to meet him?</line>
    <line id="147238">I guess I should, right? He has a family, two little girls. My dad's been helping them out financially for years. My mom's furious, of course.</line>
    <line id="147239">You have to meet him.</line>
    <line id="147240">It was like slow motion. Each punch felt like he slowly pressed his fist against my face and then slowly lifted it off.</line>
    <line id="147241">Did it hurt?</line>
    <line id="147242">Actually, no. It didn't. It wasn't until I got home that I realized my face was bloody.</line>
    <line id="147243">Jesus.</line>
    <line id="147244">I guess I shouldn't have called him that.</line>
    <line id="147245">No, definitely not.</line>
    <line id="147251">I don't like them. I don't think they belong here.</line>
    <line id="147252">Do you know how racist you sound right now?</line>
    <line id="147253">I don't care! I wish we'd kick them all outta the country. Ever single fucking one of them. They're not real Americans.</line>
    <line id="147260">I know, babe, I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice. I have to go to work tonight.</line>
    <line id="147261">But this is the fourth night in a row.</line>
    <line id="147262">I know, but it can't be helped.</line>
    <line id="147263">There isn't anyone else who can cover for you?</line>
    <line id="147264">Everyone else is working late too. It's an "all hands on deck" situation right now.</line>
    <line id="147265">I miss you.</line>
    <line id="147266">I miss you too.</line>
    <line id="147268">You really don't think it's a big deal?</line>
    <line id="147269">It's sex, it can be as meaningless or meaningful as you want it to be. You can define it for yourself, don't let other people tell you how you should view it.</line>
    <line id="147270">I guess.</line>
    <line id="147271">Look, you gotta open up your mind. Think outside of the box society has put in you.</line>
    <line id="147272">Okay, let's meet. How much?</line>
    <line id="147273">Five hundred an hour. Cash.</line>
    <line id="147280">I can't believe you're saying these things. I thought you were better than this.</line>
    <line id="147281">My first gun? Man, I was 15, it was a piece of shit 9 millimeter that jammed every other shot.</line>
    <line id="147282">Mine was a little twenty two.</line>
    <line id="147283">Damn, we were stupid kids.</line>
    <line id="147284">Yeah, stupid kids doing stupid shit.</line>
    <line id="147291">So I just need to give you five grand and you're going to turn that into fifty?</line>
    <line id="147292">Guaranteed.</line>
    <line id="147293">How you gonna do that?</line>
    <line id="147294">Just trust me. Give me five K today, that's all I need. It's a sure thing, you won't regret it.</line>
    <line id="147295">You sure you don't feel anything?</line>
    <line id="147296">Yeah, I ate the entire brownie.</line>
    <line id="147297">How long ago?</line>
    <line id="147298">About an hour or so ago.</line>
    <line id="147299">Then you should be feeling something already.</line>
    <line id="147300">I just feel a little funny, like, fuzzy at the base of my skull.</line>
    <line id="147301">You did that to a kid?</line>
    <line id="147302">A kid? Motherfucker was 17!</line>
    <line id="147303">But he was in high school. He's a kid.</line>
    <line id="147304">He got up in my face, told me he was gonna kick my ass. Asked me if I was scared. said no. He tells me he's going to beat the shit out of me unless I beg him not to. Little bitch was asking for it. I think I knocked out three of his teeth.</line>
    <line id="147305">I can't believe you did that!</line>
    <line id="147306">Man, keeping a gun at home is just asking for trouble. You're more likely to have it used against you.</line>
    <line id="147307">So what, I'm supposed to be helpless if someone breaks into my house?</line>
    <line id="147308">That's what the cops are for.</line>
    <line id="147309">Right, and how quickly do cops get out here? What am I supposed to do while I wait for them to show up? Invite the robbers in and give them a beer?</line>
    <line id="147310">Man you were talking to her for a long time.</line>
    <line id="147311">Yeah, well, you know she gave me her number when we left.</line>
    <line id="147312">Are you serious?</line>
    <line id="147313">I'm serious. She grabbed a sheet of paper, wrote her number on it and handed it to me.</line>
    <line id="147314">Man, I can't believe you got a stripper's phone number.</line>
    <line id="147315">I don't get it. I can't get a bitch's number at a bar but I go to a strip club and I come out with digits.</line>
    <line id="147316">You need to make up your mind.</line>
    <line id="147317">Look, I do like you, I really do.</line>
    <line id="147318">But?</line>
    <line id="147319">But...I don't want to date you. I mean, you'd be a great guy to marry, but I just don't see myself dating you.</line>
    <line id="147320">The fuck does that mean?</line>
    <line id="147321">I'm sorry. I just don't know how else to put it.</line>
    <line id="147322">Whatever, I don't even know what you're trying to say anymore.</line>
    <line id="147323">Then what did he say?</line>
    <line id="147324">He said he didn't love me anymore. He said there was someone else and he wanted to be with her.</line>
    <line id="147325">That motherfucker.</line>
    <line id="147326">I don't know what to do. I love him.</line>
    <line id="147327">Let me talk some sense into him.</line>
    <line id="147328">No, I know you, you'll hurt him!</line>
    <line id="147329">So that's it? No one's saying anything?</line>
    <line id="147330">You have to understand, they're scared!</line>
    <line id="147331">Yeah, yeah. Restaurant gets firebombed and nobody wants to say a thing. I know how this story goes.</line>
    <line id="147332">You can't blame them. They just don't want to get involved.</line>
    <line id="147333">That's the problem, no one ever wants to get involved.</line>
    <line id="147334">It's a shitty situation, but that's how it goes. You should know that.</line>
    <line id="147335">No I won't hurt him, I just want to have a little talk with him. That's all, I swear.</line>
    <line id="147360">It's not like the way it was when we were kids. We could avoid it all. It wasn't easy, but it was possible. Nowadays, you don't have a choice.</line>
    <line id="147361">My neighbor's kid, he just stays indoors. He never goes out. Just goes to school and church, that's it.</line>
    <line id="147362">Shit, can you imagine that? An entire childhood spent indoors. That's just wrong.</line>
    <line id="147363">He just wants to stay clear of trouble, and then go off to college, have a life outside of all... this.</line>
    <line id="147370">Wait a minute, you're worked up over some test you took on the Internet?</line>
    <line id="147371">Man, it wasn't just any sort of test, it was a test to see if you're a psychopath!</line>
    <line id="147372">So what'd this test say?</line>
    <line id="147373">That's what I'm trying to tell you! It says I have a "high probability" of being a psychopath or at least having a personality disorder.</line>
    <line id="147374">Well, what was on the test?</line>
    <line id="147375">Just a bunch of questions like, "Do you feel bad when you take advantage of someone to get ahead."</line>
    <line id="147376">What kind of stupid ass question is that? Only a pussy would say yes to that!</line>
    <line id="147384">Yeah, it's stage four or whatever.</line>
    <line id="147385">What does that mean?</line>
    <line id="147386">It means he's probably gonna die.</line>
    <line id="147387">Shit.</line>
    <line id="147388">Yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do without him.</line>
    <line id="147389">Shit man, I'm sorry.</line>
    <line id="147391">I hope he makes it, I really do.</line>
    <line id="147392">I started with twenty, right? So I put it down at the blackjack table and bam, blackjack. I got forty bucks now.</line>
    <line id="147393">Cool.</line>
    <line id="147394">Then I go to roulette. I figure I'll put forty on red and see what happens, but right before I put it down I change my mind and I put it on black.</line>
    <line id="147395">And then?</line>
    <line id="147396">Comes up black. I was on a roll. By the time the night was over, I was up two grand!</line>
    <line id="147397">I don't know, I don't feel anything.</line>
    <line id="147398">That's normal, it happens after a traumatic event.</line>
    <line id="147399">Yeah, but I've never felt anything. I just don't care. It's like, I know I'm supposed to feel sad but I just don't. I don't even feel bad that I don't feel sad. There's just nothing. It's like, a blank. A blank emotion.</line>
    <line id="147400">Come on, that can't be true. You have to feel something.</line>
    <line id="147401">That's it? You're done?</line>
    <line id="147402">Yup. I'm done! I'm just going to be single for the rest of my life and hit up strip clubs and hire hookers whenever I need some action.</line>
    <line id="147403">I don't think that sounds likes a very good plan.</line>
    <line id="147404">I don't give a fuck. I'm done with all of this shit. Fuck it, fuck everything. Hookers, strippers, and blow for me here on out.</line>
    <line id="147405">I was nervous. You know, I don't like guns. And you won't believe what happened next.</line>
    <line id="147406">Lay it on me.</line>
    <line id="147407">I fire off a round, the gun goes off, BAM! I see a spark on the target and something lands on the counter right next to me.</line>
    <line id="147408">What? What was it?</line>
    <line id="147409">I look down and it's the fucking bullet from the gun I was using! It bounced off the metal, skipped along the ceiling and landed right next to me. It was still hot!</line>
    <line id="147410">Shit. That's it, I'm not going shooting with you anytime soon.</line>
    <line id="147411">Then what happened?</line>
    <line id="147412">So we're going at, right? And it's amazing, she's a fucking demon in the sack, but I realize that I really gotta pee!</line>
    <line id="147413"> So wha-what'd you do?</line>
    <line id="147414">Well, I kept thinking she was close, so I kept at it, but she never comes and for some reason, I don't either. Maybe it's because I had to go so bad. All I know is thirty minutes later we're both still going at it and she's starting to wonder why I haven't blown my load yet.</line>
    <line id="147415">Jesus. That's, I-I don't know what to say. That's nuts.</line>
    <line id="147416">You know what I hear?</line>
    <line id="147417">If you're going to start running that cartel shit you can save your breath.</line>
    <line id="147418">But that shit is real he really does have connections! I wouldn't fuck with him.</line>
    <line id="147419">Man, even if he does have connections, I got some friends in the Viceroys who got my back.</line>
    <line id="147420">Whoa whoa whoa whoa, I think things are getting too serious, man. Let's slow down.</line>

    <line id="147422">That's good. So she's liking it here?</line>
    <line id="147423">For the most part, but some assholes are giving her a hard time.</line>
    <line id="147424">People like that are everywhere, just ignore the fuckers.</line>
    <line id="147425">Sometimes I'd just like to beat the crap out of them. Those racist fuckers.</line>

    <line id="147437">Okay, just spare me the details.</line>
    <line id="147438">What? Am I making you uncomfortable? You're the one who asked.</line>

    <line id="147441">We're past that, reasonable left the building days ago.</line>
    <line id="147442">I can't do that. I just can't.</line>
    <line id="147443">Fine, then give me twenty large.</line>
    <line id="147444">Twenty- shit, I don't have that kind of cash!</line>
    <line id="147445">Then you have a choice to make. You either man up and make things right or you find a way to get me my money.</line>
    <line id="147446">Blows? Since when did you start doing that shit?</line>

    <line id="150863">This is Mr. Crispin. I'm taking him to meet Mr. Quinn.</line>
    <line id="150864">The entire place is equipped with state of the art, man. Secret Service shit. Know what I'm saying?</line>
    <line id="150865">How comforting.</line>
    <line id="150866">Yep. Safe and fucking sound in here.</line>
    <line id="150867">Iraq oversaw it himself. He got connections, man.</line>
    <line id="150868">Place went up fast, man. That's what the boss wanted.</line>
    <line id="150872">Mr. Quinn is up there with Iraq.</line>
    <line id="150875">Mr. Crispin? No one keeps Mr. Quinn waiting. I mean nobody.</line>
    <line id="150876">Keep moving, though. Ain't good to be late for Mr. Quinn.</line>

    <line id="150884">I'm getting out of here.</line>
    <line id="150885">I'm not gonna fucking get caught by the police.</line>
    <line id="150886">Is this a raid?</line>
    <line id="150887">What's happening?</line>
    <line id="150888">Where's Quinn!</line>
    <line id="150889">Run for it!</line>
    <line id="150890">Remain calm.</line>
    <line id="150891">Please. Everyone remain calm.</line>
    <line id="150892">There's nothing to be concerned about.</line>
    <line id="150893">Get me the fuck out of here. No way am I gonna be here when the fucking cops roll in.</line>
    <line id="150895">That's him! Pearce!</line>
    <line id="150896">Hey! He ain't Crispin!</line>
    <line id="150897">He's an imposter. Get him!</line>
    <line id="150899">Shit. Need another exit.</line>

    <line id="150903">Your cash</line>
    <line id="150905">Camera Tagging</line>
    <line id="150911">Hey, you need to turn around.</line>
    <line id="150912">Area's off limits. Think I'm standing here for fun?</line>
    <line id="150913">Get out of here.</line>
    <line id="150914">Restricted area. Beat it.</line>
    <line id="150915">This area is off limits. Go back.</line>
    <line id="150916">Get lost or you get a bullet in the head.</line>
    <line id="150917">Do I look like I'm joking? I WILL shoot you.</line>
    <line id="150918">I'm not going to tell you again.</line>
    <line id="150919">Leave or I'll shoot. Simple as that.</line>
    <line id="150920">One more move, and you're dead!</line>
    <line id="150948">Back off, the area is off limits.</line>
    <line id="150949">This is a restricted area. Please leave.</line>
    <line id="150950">Hold on. No civilians allowed here.</line>
    <line id="150951">Walk away, sir. You're not authorized to be here.</line>
    <line id="150952">I'm going to have to ask you to move along.</line>
    <line id="150953">I said back off or I will shoot!</line>
    <line id="150954">Leave now, or I will open fire!</line>
    <line id="150955">Don't come any closer, I mean it!</line>
    <line id="150956">I am ordering you to walk away!</line>
    <line id="150957">This is your last warning: if you don't comply, I will shoot!</line>
    <line id="151071">So there I am waiting for my train, when the lights go out.</line>
    <line id="151073">Over my dead body. Not gonna let my ctOS baby get gummed up by that whackadoodle. Go to the central control tower. I'll jump online from the bunker.</line>
    <line id="151074">I'll call you once I'm in. Nice to have you back.</line>
    <line id="151076">I've picked up on his signal.</line>
    <line id="151077">He's creating a lot of noise. I'm gonna try a different tack.</line>
    <line id="151078">Hard to anticipate his moves.</line>
    <line id="151079">He's clever.</line>
    <line id="151080">He's a batshit wingnut. Ever try to read code of someone who's a loon-bird?</line>
    <line id="151081">Alright. Tracking him.</line>
    <line id="151082">I got you covered.</line>
    <line id="151083">Something ain't right.</line>
    <line id="151084">It's a trap.</line>
    <line id="151085">Whew. That was close.</line>
    <line id="151086">He left a trace though. Keep going.</line>
    <line id="151087">You can't take the bridge?</line>
    <line id="151088">Escaped how?</line>
    <line id="151089">What happened?</line>
    <line id="151090">That's weird. I mean, I know trailer parks have a reputation, but that's just crazy.</line>
    <line id="151092">Some people are very upset with you.</line>
    <line id="151093">You think you could get away with it?</line>
    <line id="151094">Oh god, please don't!</line>
    <line id="151095">No, no, no, no, wait, wait! Please!</line>
    <line id="151107">You should've left town, pal.</line>
    <line id="151108">Just had to do it the hard way.</line>
    <line id="151109">Some people are very upset with you.</line>
    <line id="151110">You just had to stick around, huh?</line>
    <line id="151111">Hey, eyes forward asshole.</line>
    <line id="151112">The boss ain't happy with ya.</line>
    <line id="151116">On the train. Smart.</line>

    <line id="151212">Hey wait a minute, wait a minute!</line>
    <line id="151213">No wait, you can't do this!</line>
    <line id="151214">Oh shit! Don't! Don't! Please!</line>
    <line id="151239">I can block the road.</line>
    <line id="151240">Hang on. I'll short out the transformer.</line>
    <line id="151241">I need to see around the back.</line>
    <line id="151253">Cameras'll help me here.</line>
    <line id="151254">That sign might come in handy.</line>
    <line id="151255">Last chance motherfucker. Walk off!</line>
    <line id="151256">One more step, I'm gonna put your noodles out the back of your head.</line>
    <line id="151257">You're a dead man walking if you don't piss off!</line>
    <line id="151258">You stupid, or something? I said get the fuck out of here!</line>
    <line id="151259">I've got a bullet with your name on it, so you'd better take the fuck off!</line>
    <line id="151260">Move on, fool.</line>
    <line id="151261">Viceroys only, homie.  Leave.</line>
    <line id="151262">This is our turf. Get the fuck out of here.</line>
    <line id="151263">Not so fast, homie. Get going!</line>
    <line id="151264">You're out of bounds, cuz. Get out of here.</line>
    <line id="151270">Too many of them!</line>
    <line id="151271">No! Get away! Keep away!</line>
    <line id="151273">Aiden! Wait for me.</line>

    <line id="151307">You're getting a little too curious, man. Step off.</line>
    <line id="151308">This ain't your home. Go home, man.</line>
    <line id="151309">You've got to keep walking.</line>
    <line id="151310">Take about ten steps back. And then take ten more.</line>
    <line id="151316">Generators are back there. I'll just hack the gate.</line>
    <line id="151317">Oh yes? You're showing off for me.</line>

    <line id="151331">Aiden? We can't afford to waste time.</line>
    <line id="151332">We should hurry.</line>
    <line id="151333">It isn't a good idea to be out in the open for too long. Understand?</line>
    <line id="151335">Yeah, better find another way in.</line>
    <line id="151336">Uh. Sorry. Crappy tourist map.</line>

    <line id="152860">They're speculating that he had help from the inside. Maybe even a guard.</line>
    <line id="152861">That's crazy.</line>
    <line id="152862">Yeah--if you're going to build a prison in the center of the city, you'd better make damn sure you run some kind of integrity check on your staff.</line>
    <line id="152863">She was staying at the Owl motel. She won't answer her phone.</line>
    <line id="152864">Oh God, I heard about that on the news. Is she OK?</line>
    <line id="152865">She's pretty shaken--she had two bullets crash through her window and leave holes in the wall. One of them came real close to hitting her boy.</line>
    <line id="152866">This wasn't your normal trailer dispute, trust me. These guys were some kind of organized gun nuts. They were preparing for war out there.</line>
    <line id="152867">Sounds like it found them.</line>
    <line id="152901">Yeah I got caught in that too. What a mess.</line>
    <line id="152902">I say ... why not?</line>
    <line id="152903">Ah, that place has seen enough shit over the years.</line>
    <line id="152904">Leader of the Viceroys. Head of the Club. Who's next on the list?</line>
    <line id="152905">It's always somebody...</line>
    <line id="152906">Hey! Hand over your cash and make it quick.</line>
    <line id="152907">Hey! Yeah, I'm talking to you! Hand it over!</line>
    <line id="152908">Don't move! Make it easy on yourself and hand over the cash!</line>
    <line id="152909">Hey, hey! Hand that shit over. Make it quick, bitch!</line>
    <line id="152910">Hey! Yeah, I'm talking to you! Cash! Now!</line>
    <line id="152911">Don't move! Hand over your cash! Do it now, bitch!</line>
    <line id="152923">No kidding. Hackers, though? That's just embarrassing. How did they get caught with their pants down?</line>
    <line id="152924">Hey, you wire your city together and your going to attract those kinds of people. At least they SAY they're on our side.</line>
    <line id="152925">Traffic backed up for miles and miles. Hey I thought they had a system in place to prevent these massive jams.</line>
    <line id="152926">Oh, you should have seen the size of that wreck. I don't think any system could handle that mess easily.</line>
    <line id="152934">Well it's easy to support a vigilante when you agree with him. What happens when you don't?</line>
    <line id="152935">As long as he keeps preying on those gangs, we got nothing to debate.</line>
    <line id="152936">Yeah, but where does he draw the line? You and me - we aint' exactly clean.</line>
    <line id="152951">Maybe this will be enough to tear it down. The people living there aren't there because they want to be. They need a good kick in the ass to find a place better.</line>
    <line id="152952">Which means pretty much anywhere else in the country.</line>
    <line id="152965">I don't care as long as he keeps cleaning up. Maybe City Hall is watching. Maybe they can learn something from him.</line>
    <line id="152966">They never learn, and that's why they're probably next.</line>
    <line id="152967">Do you believe them?</line>
    <line id="152968">Who was he?</line>
    <line id="152970">Yeah, I heard they had a fortress in there.</line>
    <line id="152977">Hey whoa, easy!</line>
    <line id="152978">Oh shit!</line>
    <line id="152979">Aw Jesus!</line>
    <line id="152980">Whoa!</line>
    <line id="152981">Jeez!</line>
    <line id="152982">Oh crap!</line>
    <line id="152983">Stay cool!</line>
    <line id="152984">Oh crap!</line>
    <line id="152985">Shit!</line>
    <line id="152995">I gave him a good recommendation.</line>
    <line id="152996">Just hand it over man!</line>
    <line id="152997">Just do it, now dammit!</line>
    <line id="152999">You deaf? Do it now!</line>
    <line id="153000">Come on, come on, let's go!</line>
    <line id="153001">Hurry the hell up man!</line>
    <line id="153002">You hear me, bitch? Give that shit up!</line>
    <line id="153003">Yo, quit stalling man!</line>
    <line id="153004">C'mon! Hurry up, speed it up, bitch!</line>
    <line id="153018">Look it isn't really only me who feels this way. It's all over the news. Their faces. Doesn't look good. I don't think he fits in.</line>
    <line id="153019">Uhh. What?</line>
    <line id="153020">I can't be associated with that. I'm a patriot. Maybe he's a funny guy, sure. I-I didn't know that type had a sense of humor frankly. It has nothing to do with how he looked or whatever religion those guys are. His resume was kind of off. You sure that's where he studied?</line>
    <line id="153021">It's a prestigious school.</line>
    <line id="153022">Okay you two been friends long? I'm just saying that this guy is one of them, right? Our company is a professional place. You know what I'm sayin', uh?</line>
    <line id="153023">Yeah, sure. But his type is all over the news, man. Look I can't hire him and then find out he's a fucking building bombs with the Christmas bonus money.</line>
    <line id="153029">I dunno. He was wearing gang colors. Just went nuts. Somebody was fucking with him bigtime--put his voice all over the street. It was hilarious.</line>
    <line id="153030">Pretty scary.</line>
    <line id="153031">No ... hilarious.</line>
    <line id="153043">I'm sorry, but I, I don't have any money on me!</line>
    <line id="153044">I don't have any cash on me now, I-I swear!</line>
    <line id="153045">I, I can't, I-I don't have any!</line>
    <line id="153078">They've been honest about every other leak. If they think the ctOS is being abused, I think we should definitely worry.</line>
    <line id="153079">Aren't they just a bunch of punk kids?</line>
    <line id="153080">That's the image they want you to buy ... it's all fun and games. No. These guys are more dangerous than that.</line>
    <line id="153081">Military grade weapons, man. Not just guns either. For a bunch of gangbangers, these guys have connections.</line>
    <line id="153082">I read that Wade guy--Iraq--served for a few years. Sounds like our tax dollars ended up training street gangs.</line>
    <line id="153083">Now there's a depressing thought...</line>
    <line id="153094">I don't have any, I really don't!</line>
    <line id="153095">I don't have any cash right now, I-I swear!</line>
    <line id="153096">No, I can't, I-I don't have any cash!</line>
    <line id="153097">I'm sorry, I can't! I-I just can't!</line>
    <line id="153098">I don't have any cash, I'm telling the truth!</line>
    <line id="153099">I don't have any money! I'm sorry!</line>
    <line id="153112">Just hand it over man!</line>
    <line id="153138">I'm done screwing around with you!</line>
    <line id="153139">No more dicking around!</line>
    <line id="153140">I gave you chance asshole!</line>
    <line id="153141">That's it, you're done!</line>
    <line id="153142">No more games, jackass!</line>
    <line id="153143">I don't have time for this crap!</line>
    <line id="153144">Man, I ain't got time to be fucking around with you!</line>
    <line id="153145">You should've given me the cash, bitch!</line>
    <line id="153146">You brought this shit on your motherfuckingself!</line>
    <line id="153166">It's stopping the trains too.</line>
    <line id="153167">He did?</line>
    <line id="153168">No, what?</line>
    <line id="153169">So Emperor Rat was shot?</line>
    <line id="153170">What should I do?</line>
    <line id="153171">Hey, I want to talk to you.</line>
    <line id="153172">Hey, we gotta talk.</line>
    <line id="153173">Hey, we need to talk.</line>
    <line id="153174">No. Only the bridges. They aren't even for real.</line>
    <line id="153175">They were on the news.</line>
    <line id="153176">God. You are so gullible. What kind of name is DedSec? What does that even mean?</line>
    <line id="153178">Hey, I wanna talk to you.</line>
    <line id="153180">Sure. He applied for a job as a prison guard there like four times. And now after the idiots had that mishap there, some heads are gonna roll.</line>
    <line id="153181">So he might get a job then?</line>
    <line id="153182">Stop, talk to me.</line>
    <line id="153183">You can't just ignore me.</line>
    <line id="153184">There's nothing to talk about!</line>
    <line id="153185">I'm through with you, get it?</line>
    <line id="153186">We're done, deal with it!</line>
    <line id="153187">Blume guards were in a shootout. Corporate espionage is on the rise. People are trying to steal their genius.</line>
    <line id="153188">Oh, please. I heard their guards were . Arrogant jerks with guns.</line>
    <line id="153189">You and I are over, got it?</line>
    <line id="153190">Jesus, let it go, freak!</line>
    <line id="153191">I told you, we're through!</line>
    <line id="153192">I've got nothing to say to you!</line>
    <line id="153193">We're finished, just accept it!</line>
    <line id="153194">I told you, we're done!</line>
    <line id="153195">Yeah. I think so. I can't get any definitive info online. His site is down. I've got candles lit. I'm praying.</line>
    <line id="153196">Gosh. I'll pray too.</line>
    <line id="153197">Artistic genius. Cut down in his prime.</line>
    <line id="153198">Stay indoors. Lock your doors and windows. For sure this is gonna start looting. Don't worry.</line>
    <line id="153199">But what's happening?</line>
    <line id="153200">You gotta tell the cops.</line>
    <line id="153201">For real?</line>
    <line id="153202">I'm telling you, it's suspicious.</line>
    <line id="153203">I wish I saw it.</line>
    <line id="153207">Leave me alone!</line>
    <line id="153208">Go away!</line>
    <line id="153209">Get outta here!</line>
    <line id="153210">Get away!</line>
    <line id="153211">I'll scream!</line>
    <line id="153212">Back off!</line>
    <line id="153213">We're done when I say we're done!</line>
    <line id="153214">We're not done till I say so!</line>
    <line id="153215">No, I'm not done with you yet!</line>
    <line id="153216">You're so fucking wrong. I'm not done yet.</line>
    <line id="153217">You don't get this.  I'm just getting started.</line>
    <line id="153218">We're not done, we are not done!</line>
    <line id="153219">Bitch, you're crazy. We're not done!</line>
    <line id="153220">You know this ain't fucking over!</line>
    <line id="153221">We ain't done till I say we're done!</line>
    <line id="153222">I don't believe it.</line>
    <line id="153223">You crazy? I'm sure it was that mobster - Lucky Quinn himself. He was the one with the knife. Or not, I don't know. It was dark.</line>
    <line id="153224">Holy shit. You can't tell the cops.</line>
    <line id="153225">I was working on some electrical over that way. It wasn't a gas main explosion. That motel is a dump. With a ton of shady characters there.</line>
    <line id="153226">She's your neighbor. Go over and knock. She hasn't just disappeared.</line>
    <line id="153227">I seen her kid, the boy sneaking in the house. Why would he do that? Where's his mom?</line>
    <line id="153228">You shoulda been there. The guy's speeding after him. The car must've been souped up or something. It looked like a junky station wagon, but it moved.</line>
    <line id="153229">What happened then?</line>
    <line id="153230">Don't know. We tried to race after them but they got away. Oh - and there was crazy text messages on the billboards.</line>
    <line id="153231">They were shooting a movie. I bet ya.</line>
    <line id="153232">How can you not believe it? The mayor is a scumbag. Your words. Look at everything that's happening.</line>
    <line id="153233">I'm more scared of them hackers!</line>
    <line id="153234">Get away!</line>
    <line id="153235">Go away!</line>
    <line id="153236">Back off!</line>
    <line id="153237">I'll show you!</line>
    <line id="153238">I'll set you straight!</line>
    <line id="153239">I'll teach you!</line>
    <line id="153243">Oh I'll teach you!</line>
    <line id="153244">God damn it!</line>
    <line id="153245">I'll fucking kill you!</line>
    <line id="153249">I'll kill you!</line>
    <line id="153250">God damn it!</line>
    <line id="153251">You asked for this!</line>
    <line id="153252">Die!</line>
    <line id="153253">Be gone!</line>
    <line id="153254">I'll kill you!</line>

    <line id="153266">Stop melting my brain!</line>
    <line id="153267">Get out of my head!</line>
    <line id="153268">You can't eat my soul!</line>
    <line id="153269">She's the Anti-Christ!</line>
    <line id="153270">What a freaking nutjob!</line>
    <line id="153271">What the hell?</line>
    <line id="153272">Are you completely insane?</line>
    <line id="153273">Get away from me you creep!</line>
    <line id="153274">Jesus Christ, are you nuts?</line>
    <line id="153275">Leave me alone crazy nutjob!</line>
    <line id="153276">What the hell? What the hell?</line>
    <line id="153277">Oh my God! What are you on?</line>
    <line id="153278">What? What are you talking about?</line>
    <line id="153279">Somebody! Anybody! Help!</line>
    <line id="153280">I need help! Please!</line>
    <line id="153281">Please! Help! Please!</line>
    <line id="153282">No no help me, please!</line>
    <line id="153283">Oh shit, somebody help me!</line>
    <line id="153284">Help! I need help!</line>
    <line id="153285">Somebody help me! Please!</line>
    <line id="153286">Oh Jesus, help! Please!</line>
    <line id="153287">Someone please help! Help!</line>
    <line id="153288">You won't get away with it!</line>
    <line id="153289">I won't let you do it!</line>
    <line id="153290">I'll stop your evil plan!</line>
    <line id="153291">You thought you'd get away?</line>
    <line id="153292">You can't escape justice!</line>
    <line id="153293">Judgment is at hand!</line>
    <line id="153294">You must be judged!</line>
    <line id="153295">I judge you guilty and vile!</line>
    <line id="153296">You ate my soul!</line>
    <line id="153315">Die!</line>
    <line id="153316">Go to hell!</line>
    <line id="153317">I'll kill you!</line>
    <line id="153318">TAIL TARGET</line>
    <line id="153319">Tailing mission started.</line>
    <line id="153320">You can't live scared.</line>
    <line id="153321">Shooting? Where?</line>
    <line id="153322">I dunno, I think she puts a good face on Blume.</line>
    <line id="153323">Were you working?</line>
    <line id="153324">What's with all the sirens this week?</line>
    <line id="153325">Definitely a change from the usual horny old man or bullshit, new age billionaire.</line>
    <line id="153326">There's something sharky about her smile, though.</line>
    <line id="153327">Wouldn't you have to be a shark in a company that big?</line>
    <line id="153328">I know! Seems like they've got the whole police force out on the streets every day now.</line>
    <line id="153329">Are they training?</line>
    <line id="153330">No ... have you seen them? They tear down the streets--way too dangerous to be training.</line>
    <line id="153331">Aw man it was crazy ... this guy was just chasing him down, no fear. Even when the guy in front started shooting at him.</line>
    <line id="153332">Right in the city. It looked like a scene from an action movie.</line>
    <line id="153333">Are you sure it wasn't?</line>
    <line id="153334">I went back and found where the bullets hit. It was real all right.</line>
    <line id="153335">Day off. I was on the water, though. I don't even know if they got the guys. Sped by so fast, I didn't get a good look. I was more focused on the helicopter that was running them down. In all my years as a waterdog, that's the first time I've seen the police respond like that.</line>
    <line id="153337">Rushmore did promise to go hard on criminals.</line>
    <line id="153338">I'm selling my tickets to the concert online. Screw that, with all the retaliations going on right now, it's like putting yourself right in the line of fire.</line>
    <line id="153339">Watch me. </line>
    <line id="153340">What were they thinking?</line>
    <line id="153341">Feels like the police are just going to sit back and let them wipe each other out.</line>
    <line id="153342">You ask me, they should let them play the game again.</line>
    <line id="153343">Of course we're seeing blackouts. What did they expect? What kind of power does it take to wire a whole city into one system?</line>
    <line id="153344">Somebody's cleaning house, that's for sure. I don't exactly agree with the methods, but you can't argue with the results.</line>
    <line id="153345">Hacking Cameras [HACK]:

- Target enemies to [CSS_BLUE]tag[CSS_END] them and reveal their [CSS_BLUE]Enemy Class[CSS_END]. 
- Tagged enemies appear on the [CSS_BLUE]minimap[CSS_END] and are visible behind objects.
- The [CSS_BLUE]Profiler[CSS_END] [PROFILER] can also tag enemies.</line>
    <line id="153347">I read about that. Apparently they built generators for the heavier parts of the system. They say they're planning to go green with a lot of it, too.</line>
    <line id="153348">What they say doesn't mean much when we're sitting in the dark.</line>
    <line id="153349">You would say that. </line>
    <line id="153350">Come on - you can't expect them to play at their best after a distraction that big. It's not fair to the fans or the players.</line>
    <line id="153351">I guess they'll have to adapt to our "city of the future" just like we do .</line>
    <line id="153355">I shit you not. We're talking ridiculously expensive cars. Car show cars. And they're just drag racing them through the city. I wanted to cry.</line>
    <line id="153356">Probably a couple of rich twats who didn't care if they banged them up.</line>
    <line id="153363">Wouldn't surprise me. Who wants to get stuck in the middle of this? I remember when they gave up on the Wards altogether.</line>
    <line id="153364">That's exactly why it is the way it is. If they had just gone in early and wiped them all out, they would have a castle in the middle of the ghetto.</line>

    <line id="153429">It wasn't an accident.</line>
    <line id="153430">I saw one of them in town here.</line>
    <line id="153431">I went to school with him. Junior High. Him and that deadbeat DeMarco.</line>
    <line id="153432">It's plain as day. He murdered her.</line>
    <line id="153433">Calm down and speak slowly.</line>
    <line id="153434">They're being framed.</line>
    <line id="153435">I'm starting to think it's true.</line>
    <line id="153436">What in hell are they talking about?</line>
    <line id="153437">It's all up there. On the internet.</line>
    <line id="153439">You did what?</line>
    <line id="153441">You didn't...</line>
    <line id="153442">Actually saw them load an ATM right onto the back of a truck and drive off with it.</line>
    <line id="153447">No, no!</line>
    <line id="153448">Wait, no!</line>
    <line id="153449">Oh god, no!</line>

    <line id="153508">Really? I've been seen them carrying those big arcade cabinets into Rossi-Fremont, but ATMs? They're crazy, that's just taunting the police.</line>
    <line id="153509">You think Iraq cares? King in his castle.</line>
    <line id="153510">What was I supposed to do? Be the only house on the whole block who doesn't pay them? The V's scare the shit out of me. There's this one with a skeleton on his vest ... always gets right up in my face like he's daring me to speak up.</line>
    <line id="153511">Have you ever tried?</line>
    <line id="153512">Last person who did got a drive-by thank you for it.</line>
    <line id="153538">Yeah, I gave their names to the Latin Angels.</line>
    <line id="153539">What names?</line>
    <line id="153540">All of them. With Iraq gone, now's the time to do something about the V's. So I did. Now, it's only a matter of time before the cleanup starts.</line>
    <line id="153541">Damnit - my nephew's a V!</line>
    <line id="154291">You're imagining things.  She thinks she saw one of those exotic cars that was stolen. Someone drove through town.</line>
    <line id="154292">I did see it. Should I call the police?</line>
    <line id="154293">Trevor says the police probably already know. ctOS will trace it. Honestly, stop worrying.</line>
    <line id="154299">How do you know that? Who's going to want some artist -</line>
    <line id="154300">Sculptor - he's darn good too. Though not many around here think so.</line>
    <line id="154301">Whatever. Why do you think someone was trying to murder him?</line>
    <line id="154302">His whole studio and junk yard blown to smithereens? Police lights flashing? I even heard a helicopter.</line>
    <line id="154323">You never told me that. That is wild. So did you know Lucky Quinn too?</line>
    <line id="154324">Criminy, how old do you think I am? That lizard was a fossil even twenty years ago.</line>
    <line id="154325">I bet he was always a thief. All of them. The mayor's the only one who had people fooled. Some people still think he was set up.</line>
    <line id="154354">You don't think that damn company can do anything bad, do you? Even when hackers have shown what's going on. Get your head out of your ass.</line>
    <line id="154355">Just because you're having some issues with the ctOS doesn't mean you can name call.</line>
    <line id="154356">You have no idea what's going on!</line>
    <line id="154986">It isn't only the power. We have candles. And extra water. But there are sirens wailing up and down the street. What do I do?</line>
    <line id="154987">Okay. Stay in your apartment. Do not open the door to anyone. According to the news, it's hackers messing around. Police will get them.</line>
    <line id="155008">Do you have any idea how easy it is to mess with video? Don't believe the internet.</line>
    <line id="155009">How can we know anything anymore, if all these things can be -</line>
    <line id="155094">Not everyone loves the ctOS network. It's had a lot of problems.</line>
    <line id="155095">Hackers. They're the darn problem.</line>
    <line id="155096">Yeah, well, Blume is at least partially to blame.</line>
    <line id="155105">Leave me alone!</line>
    <line id="155106">Get away from me!</line>
    <line id="155107">Get out of here!</line>

    <line id="155111">I won't be bought!</line>
    <line id="155112">The answer is still no!</line>
    <line id="155113">I'm not changing my mind!</line>
    <line id="155120">It is true! The vigilante has been tearing the mob down. Piece by piece. And this proves it.</line>
    <line id="155121">One man? That doesn't seem possible.</line>
    <line id="155122">Yeah. I don't know. Maybe he isn't the only one -</line>
    <line id="155128">I'm on his side, that's for sure.</line>
    <line id="155129">Our power is out. It's making us nuts. Even our phone service keeps cutting out. I heard the stuff about the mayor. But what else is there?</line>
    <line id="155130">Remember your uncle's manager job with the city?</line>
    <line id="155131">Oh no. You always said he was crooked.</line>
    <line id="155132">The lowest of the low. And now it's there black and white with photographs.</line>
    <line id="155134">There's something about the docks.</line>
    <line id="155137">Trying to get home.</line>
    <line id="155142">The club uses the river for the smuggling. It hasn't been set up with network cameras yet. At least that I know of.</line>
    <line id="155143">The whole thing gives me the creeps. I can't believe it's happening in our city. Under the cops noses.</line>
    <line id="155144">Oh! You didn't hear? The cops are in on it too.</line>
    <line id="155160">Don't go the usual way. The trains are down. Traffic lights are causing a pile up.</line>
    <line id="155161">What's the deal.</line>
    <line id="155216">Rushmore does what he says.</line>
    <line id="155237">Yeah. Getting tough on gangs. There's an ethical dilemma.</line>
    <line id="155238">The stadium. And now this prison thing? I'm worried.</line>
    <line id="155239">You're always worried. Look, the police -</line>
    <line id="155250">How do you know this?</line>
    <line id="155261">Because I read, man. No one reads anymore. Or at least not the right things. This guy Kenney was a genius. But he disappeared. He got executed by the mob. They hired him to blackout New York City.</line>
    <line id="155262">Sounds like you're reading junk -</line>
    <line id="155263">ctOS isn't working right.</line>
    <line id="155269">Oh god, will you stop. Enough with the paranoia. How do you know?</line>
    <line id="155270">You serious? How did that vigilante manage to get around the cameras - they're everywhere.</line>
    <line id="155271">They know who he is now.</line>
    <line id="155272">And what about the billboards? Those - those electronic thingies.</line>
    <line id="155273">Those messages are an ad campaign. Defalt's some ad for clothes or whatever. You -</line>
    <line id="155348">You better have good news for me, pal.</line>
    <line id="155349">So, you bring it? Tell me you brought it.</line>
    <line id="155353">Hey, you got the shit or what, dude?</line>
    <line id="155354">Yo, all I know is you better have that shit.</line>
    <line id="155355">Simple question, do you got the shit?</line>

    <line id="155547">Sounds exciting.</line>
    <line id="155657">Look, you can't go on like this ... you have to eat. Listen--I understand ... leaving him was the scariest thing you could have done. But it'll get better. I know it feels wrong. I know this isn't your home--but it can be. It should be. No--don't. Don't say anything. Just let me finish ... please--it's taken me months to build up the courage to do this. I was afraid you'd think I was just some creep, but I'm not. I'm here for you. But we have to get you healthy. You need to eat.</line>
    <line id="155658">MISSION FAILED</line>

    <line id="155660">MISSION FAILED</line>
    <line id="155661">Target was killed.</line>
    <line id="155746">I agree with the message. Maybe not the method.</line>
    <line id="155747">It's a good opportunity for you.</line>
    <line id="155748">No. They're shutting it down for maintenance.</line>
    <line id="155812">What message? They're all over the place. Unplug the city - oh wait - look we wrecked the train and bridge to make our point.</line>
    <line id="155813">Right. That's their point. It's vulnerable -</line>
    <line id="155814">So we're supposed to give up convenience? Rushmore's right. They're criminals and they all need to be arrested.</line>

    <line id="156086">It is! I feel a little uneasy about how it came about -</line>
    <line id="156087">It isn't your fault the gang was gunned down. Your company can finally get in there.</line>
    <line id="156088">It's still going to cost us so much in setup. The place is a dump. Hell, the whole area is a dump.</line>

    <line id="156165">I think the police are telling people there's a vigilante to distract them from the real crime level.</line>
    <line id="156166">That makes no sense. People have seen him.</line>
    <line id="156167">Sure they have.</line>
    <line id="156178">Yeah. Not many cops on the force know about it. It used to spy on Club operations before they got all digital.</line>
    <line id="156179">Cool! Think you can show it to me sometime?</line>
    <line id="156180">Not a good idea. Some bad cops use it as their operation now. Anyway, they did up 'til it got shot up.</line>
    <line id="156181">So cool. It's like Capone shit, man.</line>
    <line id="156202">Don't know why Blume ever hired them gun happy militants. Unless they had some dirty deeds.</line>
    <line id="156203">I can't get my head around this.</line>
    <line id="156204">Trailer's are all shot up. No residents were hurt, thank the Lord.</line>
    <line id="156220">Quinn's? Yeah. It's weird to me - I think Quinn set him up.</line>
    <line id="156221">Set him up to murder that woman?</line>
    <line id="156222">Sure. He was a mob boss, man.</line>
    <line id="156223">You don't think that maybe Quinn was blackmailing the mayor?</line>
    <line id="156224">Nope. And I'll tell you why -</line>
    <line id="156226">I'm still blown away. I don't get it.</line>
    <line id="156236">Why weren't you watching the game?</line>
    <line id="156237">What?</line>
    <line id="156241">The guy hacked the prison. They're still trying to decide if he was breaking somebody out.</line>
    <line id="156242">What? So wait - they think he was breaking in?</line>
    <line id="156243">In the city?</line>
    <line id="156244">Oh he knew exactly what he was doing. Every gesture is a subtle threat. Why do you think he let himself be interviewed? It was a big "don't fuck with me" aimed right at the public.</line>
    <line id="156254">Had to pee. And I was a little drunk, so I got lost. I was wandering around the hallways when I heard the gunshots. You know what I did? Held it in. Went right back to my seat.</line>
    <line id="156255">Damn. Good thing you did. I saw the crime scene on the news and it was ugly.</line>
    <line id="156256">Saw the weirdest thing over by Dogpatch.</line>
    <line id="156257">Bunch of homeless guys with cell phones, all chatting away. How would they even get a plan?</line>
    <line id="156258">Probably stolen. Sounds like the Cardboard Mafia strikes again. Hide your booze and hide your cell phones.</line>
    <line id="156259"> Stop, that's just wrong.</line>
    <line id="156272">Those guys were killed by a sniper.</line>
    <line id="156273">Scary, huh? At least he's picking of gangbangers with it. Hate to think of all the nice vantage points he has in this city.</line>
    <line id="156274">Thanks for adding a huge dose of paranoia to my day. I appreciate it.</line>
    <line id="156285">I saw that guy interviewed a couple of times. Scary. I don't think he realized that his smile only made him look meaner.</line>
    <line id="156286">Isn't that where you play paintball?</line>
    <line id="156287">It was just some kid, wasn't it?</line>
    <line id="156288">What happened?</line>
    <line id="156289">Just another internet superstar if you ask me. They'll forget about him in a couple of weeks and move onto the next one.</line>
    <line id="156290">Somebody's always got a theory.</line>
    <line id="156297">You sure? Who can I call to find out?</line>
    <line id="156298">Cars going in and out. All hours.</line>
    <line id="156300">What do I care? Vigilante? That man is out for himself.</line>
    <line id="156301">It is! Why don't you remember?</line>
    <line id="156469">Think this is going your way?</line>
    <line id="156471">There's more of us, you know.</line>
    <line id="156473">You haven't won jack shit.</line>
    <line id="156475">We want you dead and nothing less.</line>
    <line id="156477">Others are already on the way.</line>
    <line id="156630">No more jokes. Get the fuck out of here.</line>
    <line id="156631">Last warning. Or I'll shoot.</line>
    <line id="156632">Take a hike or I'll blow you away!</line>
    <line id="156633">You got a death wish? Leave now or you're dead.</line>
    <line id="156634">One more move, and you die!</line>
    <line id="157264">You need to go.</line>
    <line id="157265">This area's a no-go zone. Beat it.</line>
    <line id="157266">Restricted area. Get lost.</line>
    <line id="157267">Can't go this way. Turn around.</line>
    <line id="157268">No one allowed beyond this point.</line>
    <line id="157297">No, no, no this is more than just a theory. Seriously, ask anyone you know if they voted for Rushmore. They're going to say no.</line>
    <line id="157298">I voted for Rushmore.</line>
    <line id="157299">What? Why would you do that? You don't really buy what he's selling, do you?</line>
    <line id="157300">Ma'am. We can't release any more information. Do you want to leave the names of your friends who were at the stadium during the incident?</line>
    <line id="157301">Well - Do I have to?</line>
    <line id="157302">Just a kid? You do realize that just a kid with the right tools could shut down this city, right? Besides ... if they get into his computer, they might be able to track his friends and take down the whole damn lot of them.</line>
    <line id="157303">Did you get plate numbers like last time?</line>
    <line id="157304">Didn't have to. It's the same ones.</line>
    <line id="157305">Any idea what might be going on? What are people saying around there?</line>
    <line id="157306">Yo, Iraq doesn't talk to me or anybody else. But I tell you one thing... If he's rubbing shoulders with that Lucky Quinn, he's got a plan to take him out.</line>
    <line id="157307">MISSION FAILED</line>
    <line id="157308">You exited the mission area.</line>
    <line id="157317">WARNING</line>
    <line id="157318">The briefcase is out of sight.</line>
    <line id="157319">He's always bugging me about the new code he's writing. You know, he's all like, "No one out there is doing this shit!" You know what he's writing? Simple trojans. Worms. 1990 shit. Obsolete shit, man. Nevermind anti-virus security. My grandma could sniff that crap out. So I sent the cops to his door. Had a good laugh.</line>
    <line id="157320">I'm just out, trying to have a good time, and this meathead gets up in my face, saying I'm macking on his girl. I told him, sorry, man, I don't swing that way, but that doesn't stop him. It's a shame, he was pretty cute for a jackass. So I went easy on him, broke his hand.</line>
    <line id="157321">You've got to watch out. A lot of companies say their food's organic, and don't mean it. There's no regulation on that sort of thing, so anyone can slap an "organic" label on a bunch of bananas and sell them for double. Uncool. Look it up. Be informed. Real organic farmers need our support.</line>
    <line id="157334">Right out of a movie.</line>
    <line id="157335">The tvs just started displaying messages. It looked like some kind of reality show or something.</line>
    <line id="157336">What did they say?</line>
    <line id="157337">Creepy stuff. Like "They took everything from me!"</line>
    <line id="157338">Definitely creepy.</line>
    <line id="157339">Close to it, yeah. Turns out some nutjob set up all kinds of traps out there. Looked like he was preparing for World War 3. I bet they find some sort of manifesto.</line>
    <line id="157340">Did they catch him?</line>
    <line id="157341">Doesn't sound like it.</line>
    <line id="157342">I don't know what to think. It's some story. Either way, V's aren't wiped out like they think.</line>
    <line id="157343">World's all upside down.</line>
    <line id="157344">I don't know, man. People eat up this vigilante shit. Just watch - in a "couple of weeks," we'll have copycats.</line>
    <line id="157345">You thinking about putting on a hat and mask?</line>
    <line id="157346">What? You don't think I could pull it off?</line>
    <line id="157352">Who were they after?</line>
    <line id="157355">Wait. Are you serious? Something interesting happened in Pawnee?</line>
    <line id="157356">It was a year ago. Why on earth do you think I'd remember some lady who came around door to door?</line>
    <line id="157357">Rose Washington? You told her she was as pretty as a rose! And I kicked you -</line>
    <line id="157358">Oh yeah. Damn shame. She was pretty.</line>
    <line id="157363">The agency will call with another -</line>
    <line id="157364">Of course I'm not seeing things.</line>
    <line id="157384">They won't! I told them it was the damn train system. The stupid broad said it was my responsibility or some shit. I needed that job.</line>
    <line id="157388">Try another agency.</line>
    <line id="157389">The motel owner turned over the records, but everything was fake. Whoever he is, he must have fucked up good. They sent a small army to his room to make sure he was dead.</line>
    <line id="157390">How'd he get out?</line>
    <line id="157391">Shot his way out, apparently.</line>
    <line id="157394">Haw. Haw. It's not all farm and field out here, you know. We have our own culture.</line>
    <line id="157395">Well now you have our vigilante, too. You're welcome.</line>
    <line id="157397">Jesus no, help!</line>
    <line id="157398">Somebody help me!</line>
    <line id="157399">No, no! Don't!</line>
    <line id="157400">No! Not in the face!</line>
    <line id="157401">No, don't do it!</line>
    <line id="157402">Don't shoot, please!</line>
    <line id="157403">Jesus Christ!</line>
    <line id="157404">Holy shit, no!</line>
    <line id="157405">Oh god, no, no!</line>
    <line id="157409">Lucky Quinn sends his regards, you bastard.</line>
    <line id="157410">Hey asshole, Lucky Quinn says hello.</line>
    <line id="157411">Here's a little something from Lucky Quinn.</line>
    <line id="157412">Hold it right there, I have something for you.</line>
    <line id="157413">I've been looking for you. This is from Lucky Quinn.</line>
    <line id="157414">Hey Pal, here's a little something from Lucky Quinn.</line>
    <line id="157415">Hey, I have a message for you from Lucky Quinn.</line>
    <line id="157416">Lucky Quinn wants me to deliver a message.</line>
    <line id="157417">Hey, I have a message for you. Don't move.</line>
    <line id="157418">Dumb bastard.</line>
    <line id="157419">Freakin' pussy.</line>
    <line id="157420">Lights out.</line>
    <line id="157421">Fuckin'moron.</line>
    <line id="157422">Freakin' waste of space.</line>
    <line id="157423">Goddamned jackass.</line>
    <line id="157424">Useless shit.</line>
    <line id="157425">Die asshole!</line>
    <line id="157426">Dumb fuck.</line>
    <line id="157427">He just came flying off some side path, and I mean flying ... cleared a couple lanes of the highway and landed like it was nothing new.</line>
    <line id="157428">Wish they'd just tear down Rossi-Freemont. It would be like getting rid of a roach nest.</line>
    <line id="157429">Let's see Charlotte-whats-her-face put a positive spin on this one.</line>
    <line id="157430">Oh no. Here it comes.</line>
    <line id="157432">Some white guy is wandering around Rossi, and none of the Viceroys do anything?</line>
    <line id="157433">Something is going on. This is what I'm telling -</line>
    <line id="157434">They aren't all criminals in there. Just lots of normal people just trying to get by.</line>
    <line id="157435">Bullshit. I've seen the TV reports. They cover for them any time the police try to clean up.</line>
    <line id="157436">You assume they have a choice.</line>
    <line id="157448">I stay far away from Bedbug and his crew.</line>
    <line id="157449">The Blume bridge? Man, you know they ain't interested in hiring us out that way?</line>
    <line id="157450">Afraid so.</line>
    <line id="157451">Serves them right. I say let the city burn.</line>
    <line id="157463">That is crazy! I wonder what his problem was.</line>
    <line id="157464">I dunno. But if I ever meet the man, I want to shake his hand -- I've never seen any kind of stunt like that before.</line>
    <line id="157468">They released his name?</line>
    <line id="157482">I have a theory...</line>
    <line id="157483">There's more than one vigilante. It's some kind of activist ... and I mean really active activist group. How else are they causing havoc in both Chicago and Pawnee. You really think one guy could do all this?</line>
    <line id="157485">Oh she will. She's probably got a crack team of lawyers and publicists crafting some epic response now. The ctOS could sink a city block and Blume would still come out looking like heroes.</line>
    <line id="157495">I hear you, man. But these past few days, I see him walking all over. In and out. Back and forth.</line>
    <line id="157496">So what?</line>
    <line id="157497">Something is going on with that one. I can tell you that. And we're all gonna be caught up in whatever it is-</line>
    <line id="157504">Whatever.</line>
    <line id="157505">Yo it's done!</line>
    <line id="157506">Hey this is goodbye!</line>
    <line id="157507">Fuck yourself!</line>
    <line id="157508">You're done!</line>
    <line id="157509">It's over!</line>
    <line id="157513">Go fuck yourself!</line>
    <line id="157514">Man, fuck this!</line>
    <line id="157515">Fuck you!</line>
    <line id="157522">You thought you could get away with it?</line>
    <line id="157523">You pissed off the wrong people.</line>
    <line id="157524">Yo, I told you I'd be back.</line>
    <line id="157525">Hey hey you thought you could screw with us?</line>
    <line id="157526">Hey don't stick your nose where it don't belong!</line>
    <line id="157527">Hey! Don't mess with the Viceroys!</line>
    <line id="157528">Yo, look at me, mo'fucker!</line>
    <line id="157529">Had to do things the hard way.</line>
    <line id="157530">Hey, look at me bitch.</line>
    <line id="157531">No, wait! I can explain!</line>
    <line id="157532">No, wait! Please!</line>
    <line id="157533">Oh god, please don't!</line>
    <line id="157534">Wait, please! I can pay you!</line>
    <line id="157535">No no, you got the wrong guy!</line>
    <line id="157536">Please, you gotta listen to me!</line>
    <line id="157537">Wait a minute, just wait a minute!</line>
    <line id="157538">No wait, you can't do this!</line>
    <line id="157539">Oh shit! Don't! Please!</line>
    <line id="157552">Shut your damn face, pussy!</line>
    <line id="157553">Shut the hell up, bitch!</line>
    <line id="157554">Man, suck it up, motherfucker!</line>
    <line id="157555">I don't wanna hear no excuses!</line>
    <line id="157556">Man, shut your mouth, bitch!</line>
    <line id="157557">Naw, don't even start!</line>
    <line id="157558">I don't wanna hear that shit, mo'fucker!</line>
    <line id="157559">Shut up! Shut your ass up!</line>
    <line id="157560">Don't say a damn word, bitch!</line>
    <line id="157561">No, no!</line>
    <line id="157562">Wait, no!</line>
    <line id="157563">Oh god, no!</line>
    <line id="157564">Please, no!</line>
    <line id="157565">Don't, please!</line>
    <line id="157566">Wait, don't!</line>
    <line id="157567">Wait, please!</line>
    <line id="157568">No, wait!</line>
    <line id="157569">Don't, wait!</line>
    <line id="157581">Yup. Aiden Pearce.</line>
    <line id="157582">Aiden Pearce. Aiden Pearce. Nah. I thought he'd have a tough guy name.</line>
    <line id="157583">What's wrong with his name? I think it sounds kind of sexy ... like a porn star.</line>
    <line id="157584">TUTORIAL</line>
    <line id="157585">Use security cameras to tag enemies</line>
    <line id="157603">Been trying to get on that construction crew for months.</line>
    <line id="157604">I'll keep trying. That town could do with a few charming black men around.</line>
    <line id="157607">What do they think we are? All a bunch of gang bangers?</line>
    <line id="157608">That uptown gallery thing wasn't no gang. I'm getting sick and tired of them getting away with being crooked. When are they going to stop pointing at our boys? And -</line>
    <line id="157609">That isn't very neighborly. You've been hanging around me too long.</line>
    <line id="157610">All them rich overstuffed shirts can kiss my overworked ass.</line>
    <line id="157611">It's all over the news and internet. It's like some end of days thing. Anarchy delivered in digital.</line>
    <line id="157612">Too boring for me.</line>
    <line id="157616">I left it where you said to.</line>
    <line id="157617">But if you can put me through -</line>
    <line id="157619">I think he's a riot. Everytime there's a mic in his face you get to watch him eat his foot.</line>
    <line id="157620">How did he get back in, man? Horseshoe way up his ass.</line>
    <line id="157621">And feet down his throat!</line>
    <line id="157626">That's good. Is it all there? Fourteen cases?</line>
    <line id="157627">Yeah, man. I'm not snowing you.</line>
    <line id="157628">Were you followed?</line>
    <line id="157629">No. That wasn't the problem. It was the cameras I was afraid of.</line>
    <line id="157630">I told you the boss has some hacking genius in his pocket. He made sure they were offline. It's all good.</line>
    <line id="157631">Sir. He's in meetings all day.</line>
    <line id="157632">What if I come down there? In person. What about that?</line>
    <line id="157633">The mayor's schedule is much too busy, sir.</line>
    <line id="157634">Listen to me. This is important. He's gonna want to hear me out.</line>
    <line id="157635">Sir, if you could -</line>
    <line id="157636">How much?</line>
    <line id="157637">An installment plan is available to you. Do you want to book an appointment?</line>
    <line id="157644">See? That's exactly why I don't drive through the Wards anymore.</line>
    <line id="157645">Why do you think that?</line>
    <line id="157646">Who?</line>
    <line id="157652">Why can't you?</line>
    <line id="157653">Pick up. Pick up. Come on -</line>
    <line id="157654">Hello?</line>
    <line id="157655">Where the hell have you been? This shit - all this crap at the city network.</line>
    <line id="157656">Slow down. What the fuck? Why are you calling - I told you text only. You know I don't answer -</line>
    <line id="157657">You and your DedSec shit. You're one of them aren't you?</line>
    <line id="157658">Don't be a headcase. It doesn't suit you.</line>
    <line id="157669">Think about it ... it ain't about the TV anymore. They want social media links. Net chatter. Updates. How do you do that? You need an upset. So you black out your stadium. Stage a little criminal scenario in the back rooms. Everybody's talking about it.</line>
    <line id="157670">You are so full of it.</line>
    <line id="157671">At least you have a choice. I have to raise my babies a block from where all this shit's going down. How do I protect them?</line>
    <line id="157672">Maybe this one will blow over. Just keep them inside for a few days.</line>
    <line id="157673">I have two bullet holes in my living room window from earlier this year.</line>
    <line id="157674">Raymond Kenney. Remember him? The guy behind the blackouts in New York. Also had some part in building the ctOS. Now all that shit in Pawnee - that was him.</line>
    <line id="157675">How do you know?</line>
    <line id="157676">Let's just say I have friends in odd places.</line>
    <line id="157682">Where were the cops?</line>
    <line id="157683">A mob? Really?</line>
    <line id="157695">Apparently, the brass got an order to keep them leashed. They knew something was going down, but they were ordered to let it work itself out.</line>
    <line id="157696">Aren't there families in Rossi-Freemont?</line>
    <line id="157697">Yeah. But what have the cops ever done to protect them before? Nothing.</line>
    <line id="157698">I told you I have a few things to do. Don't get in my face about it.</line>
    <line id="157699">Like what? Tell me one thing.</line>
    <line id="157700">I got a contract to go kill a guy.</line>
    <line id="157701">If you don't want to tell me just say so.</line>
    <line id="157702">When you get home. Watch the news. There's a lot going on right now. A lot of rich men who made some bad mistakes.</line>
    <line id="157703">I feel safer.</line>
    <line id="157704">It's all a bunch of overblown hype.</line>
    <line id="157705">But they know his name. So why can't they go to his house and get him?</line>
    <line id="157706">That's what I think. We get our torches and pitchforks and we march right up to Blume's central office and burn the witch.</line>
    <line id="157707">Come on. She's just PR.</line>
    <line id="157708">She's a liar. That's what she is.</line>
    <line id="157709">It's part of his shows.</line>
    <line id="157710">You think he might've been on it?</line>
    <line id="157712">Seriously, what gives them the right to speak for us? We elect people to do that.</line>
    <line id="157713">Sorry to hear that.</line>
    <line id="157715">He what?</line>
    <line id="157727">Who? The government? Do you believe they speak for you? Do you even believe your votes meant anything. It's all one big scam put into place to abuse the common people. DedSec is going to expose it all and then you'll wake up.</line>
    <line id="157728">Pfffft. Whatever.</line>
    <line id="157731">Yeah ... I mean, I can't do this without her. She's my voice on the street - the only one I have that can communicate with these kids. But without her son, since he's missing, she's a mess.</line>
    <line id="157732">What's his name?</line>
    <line id="157733">The only name he goes by is "Bedbug," but I don't know why anyone would call themselves that.</line>
    <line id="157734">Totally. I don't get that Madison and Jamie are worried about privacy but they still put all their shit up on their sites.</line>
    <line id="157735">I know right? So why should they care if there's cameras around.</line>
    <line id="157736">And it's in public! Oh my god! It's like are they going to say to citizens on the frigging street - hey, don't look at me? - No. So why is a camera any different?</line>
    <line id="157737">I'll talk to her.</line>
    <line id="157738">He called me up like everything was fine. After I was crying myself to sleep every night because I thought he was dead.</line>
    <line id="157739">Thank god he's ok. So what happened?</line>
    <line id="157740">Iraq is dead, that's for sure. Now my boy thinks he's gonna step up and lead the Viceroys. Damn fool needs to get out while he can.</line>
    <line id="157741">They're trying to get people to pay attention. It isn't just in Chicago. They're all over. They hacked a few giant corporations in Europe too.</line>
    <line id="157744">Because they advertised his name. They're so stupid. He outfoxes them every time.</line>
    <line id="157745">He probably left the state.</line>
    <line id="157746">No way. He's Chicago homegrown. He's sticking it out here. I bet you anything.</line>
    <line id="157747">That he wears a mask and flashes lights? Well, gawd. Anyone can do that. It's not worth the price of admission.</line>
    <line id="157748">You so don't get him. He's an artist.</line>
    <line id="157749">He's a boy dressed up as a rat.</line>
    <line id="157750">Are you whacked in the head? You think the mayor was hallucinating -</line>
    <line id="157751">Oooh! Or hypnotized!</line>
    <line id="157752">The shit relaxes you. It doesn't make you kill people. Fuck. Get real.</line>
    <line id="157753">Sure. It's okay.</line>
    <line id="157754">My parents were furious when they moved it into the city.</line>
    <line id="157755">Are you sure? Maybe it's part of that auction thing -</line>
    <line id="157756">Do you know her?</line>
    <line id="157757">Do you know if your deal is in there?</line>
    <line id="157758">Why there's a prison in the city I do not understand. It should've stayed in Pawnee or wherever.</line>
    <line id="157759">Blume took over the prison building there. Isn't that wild?</line>
    <line id="157760">I didn't know that. Imagine working there -</line>
    <line id="157761">It's produced by Emperor Rat. I didn't even know what that when I first tried it.</line>
    <line id="157762">And? What happened?</line>
    <line id="157763">It was kind of like being hypnotized. All the buildings were like crazy.</line>
    <line id="157764">Shouldn't try it outdoors. I never would.</line>
    <line id="157765">Anything's possible, I guess. Creeps are everywhere, all the time. I sure do hope they find who did this.</line>
    <line id="157766">Serial killer? Uck. Aren't you scared?</line>
    <line id="157767">Oh. I don't think he lives here. I think he's using it as a dumping ground. 'Course I'm not a police officer.</line>
    <line id="157824">Not really. I seen her around, with her son. Her daughter was killed in a car accident.</line>
    <line id="157825">So that's why he's - that's why he does what he does?</line>
    <line id="157826">Doubt it. It's too obvious. This guy's more complicated than that. No one just decides to go around taking out criminals.</line>
    <line id="157827">No. I don't know. It's a frickin ton of data. Have you seen it?</line>
    <line id="157828">Calm down. This could work in your favor.</line>
    <line id="157829">What are you talking about?</line>
    <line id="157830">If this data dump is as large as you say it is, no one's going to read it all. Am I right?</line>
    <line id="157831">Yeah that's true. People have the attention span of gnat. Nobody's gotta notice my backroom deal. Especially with that mayor shit.</line>
    <line id="157832">Rushmore saved your ass. And you never even voted for him.</line>
    <line id="158054">Just gave 'em out. Kind of a peace offering, I guess.</line>
    <line id="158055">CAMERA ACTIVITY DETECTED</line>

    <line id="158058">Don't put yourself in danger.</line>
    <line id="158059">All we did was let him set up a little place in back.</line>
    <line id="158060">Yeah, he's made a few trips down there. I've seen him do it.</line>
    <line id="158061">How? Does he have a boat?</line>
    <line id="158062">He takes the bridge.</line>
    <line id="158063">The bridge is abandoned. Doesn't move.</line>
    <line id="158064">It does. Seen that too. Hey--you're not going to hurt him are you?</line>
    <line id="158065">I don't like him being here. Tobias. What kinda name is that? Been a lot of strange men poking around Dogpatch since he moved in.</line>
    <line id="158066">Why don't you get rid of him?</line>
    <line id="158067">If he goes, so do our phones. I won't be able to talk to you no more.</line>
    <line id="158068">Well you could always come see me. There's still a room waiting for you if you want it.</line>

    <line id="169558">My name is Rose Washington... and I'm uploading this log because... I'm scared for my life. I used to work at Blume. I don't know what happened to the others... Tobias and Ray. We were all fired. Someone's watching me.</line>
    <line id="169560">Someone is exploiting the ctOS access. Somehow they have Ray's encryption key. With it they could sabotage the network. Tobias has gotten even crazier and I can't find Ray. It's only me. I've managed to trace the hacker... he used a server at City Hall.</line>
    <line id="169562">Traces of the hacker are all over City Hall network. I can't tell if it's one hacker or if he's part of that group. But I found what he was looking for... a list of dead people registered to vote. Each name was given an address in Rossi-Fremont. And the list of names was courtesy of ctOS network... except that the network wasn't supposed to be online then.</line>
    <line id="169564">I think someone is selling access to the network. Mayor Rushmore and his entire team  have been pushing hard for ctOS integration. It's his entire platform. Either he's oblivious or he's in on it. I'm going to get closer and find out.</line>
    <line id="169566">Someone's been following me. I've already burned two phones. I have to get out. But I can't. The entire city is vulnerable. Donovan... Mayor Rushmore is growing more fond of me. And I don't know how I feel about it. The election's coming up fast. I overheard Don on the phone... The voter list is set to run through some new ctOS algorithm. I'm going to hack into his personal files and see what I can find.</line>

    <line id="169611">Huh. This might be our guy. But I need to know for sure.</line>

    <line id="169641">...No. I never met him. Why?</line>
    <line id="169642">They were his daughters. All of them.</line>
    <line id="169643">Sixteen daughters?</line>
    <line id="169644">And probably more. He abandoned them all and was tracking them down to...save them. Redeem himself as a father, maybe.</line>
    <line id="169645">So then, if he...oh God. Oh God!</line>

    <line id="169647">I've got to go.</line>
    <line id="169650">Uhh... so yeah... Nurse Smiles-A-Lot gave me this. Apparently I was nattering in my sleep. "Mumbling nonsense," she said. That's right. It is nonsense to some dense prole. But us outliers... we know, don't we? We know it's value. This fucking recording shit makes me feel ridiculous. Like Richard Nixon narrating his cross dressing secrets.

    <line id="169654">I'm a mess. So I've decided to tidy up. Find out who did this to me. Find out who stole my algorithm. Who even knew what I was working on?  What? Stop smiling at me, you silly cow. Jam your physical therapy up your - Hey!  Wait. Come back. Maybe I do want a change of scenery. Wheel me out of here. To the lobby.  Plenty of laptops down there I can borrow. I'll find who did this -  I'll get a wheelchair.  I'll break her happy spirit. Everyone breaks eventually.</line>
    <line id="169656">Traced back all of the accounts from the Merlaut job. And look at what I found... another hacker fucking around at the same time. Imagine that? A double heist. Aiden's gone dark. Just this... Lena Pearce obituary. Huh. Well, maybe he wasn't the one who sold me out. He didn't even know about my algorithm. Fuck him anyway.</line>

    <line id="169779">Trains. Water. Power. Have all been integrated into the network. Traffic in the outlying districts is set to be tied in later this week. All systems are active. And I'm happy to report, gentlemen, that there are no issues. Let me just say, that I'm excited for Blume. I appreciate the faith the Board of Directors has in me. And I assure you, under my watch, everything runs smoothly.</line>
    <line id="169781">The predictive algorithm is a remarkable program. Yes, Sir. But this is more than a standard Bellwether model. It holds great potential. We've already seen it in action with the election. Beyond that, yes. Essentially it's able to adapt... understand... and learn. I can see by your expressions you're as excited about this, as I am. What this means, gentlemen, is that this algorithm is able to anticipate patterns. We've already run tests to see if we can influence those patterns. So far, we have success...</line>
    <line id="169783">Naysayers. Protestors. Hacker groups. Each one has its own agenda. Yes, the ctOS network has suffered attacks. But these are minor. Gentlemen, I can assure you... Our system is robust. Our firewall protection is stronger. As you know, a number of security protocols have been implemented by our elite security team. I see you've all been equipped with your upgraded ID. I can assure you... These cyber-attacks are not a viable threat to the ctOS network or Blume's research. With our security team on it, I have great faith that we will have a breach-free network in the next month.</line>
    <line id="169785">I appreciate that you've given me extensive control and autonomy on this issue. Our security team assures us that key members of the hacker group, DedSec, can and will be taken care of. They've already begun a number of methods to deal with the attacks. Our programming team tells me, that we've even benefited from these attacks. The network is learning. Able to detect intrusions and execute counter measures. Details are in the report in front of you. Already, the network has managed to locate some of the attackers. Gentlemen, I am committed to protecting Blume and its interests. The concerns regarding some of our shareholders has been mitigated. No data exists of any compromising positions. I stake my reputation on it.</line>
    <line id="169787">Any and all “issues” have been dealt with, and are currently being fixed. Tests consistently show us that citizens are attracted to the ease of use above all else. Blume is about global family. Blume is about ease of use. ctOS network is a positive in people's lives. Our research data shows they're willing to endure the occasional hiccup. The public will stay on our side, I assure you. My recommendation to the Board of Directors is that we continue as planned. It's time to roll out phase two, gentlemen.</line>

    <line id="171867">Where is The Fox? That is the question on everyone's mind as the citizens demand that the violent vigilante be brought to justice. The ctOS is fully functional, the police remind us, and the tip lines are always open. They assure us with both systems in place, the vigilante will be caught. The ctOS certainly has the track record to back up that statement.</line>
    <line id="171868">Chicago's vigilante continues his reign of chaos and police seem incapable of stopping him. Citizens are advised not to approach the vigilante if they see him. He has been linked to several violent altercations and police warn that he carries a firearm. Witnesses are encouraged to use the anonymous tip line if they have information or call 911 if they spot the vigilante.</line>
    <line id="171869">Is the vigilante an agent of good or ill? According to our online poll, people are evenly divided. A considerable number of pollsters remain undecided.</line>
    <line id="171871">What the fuck?</line>
    <line id="171872">In other news, police are baffled by the outpouring of support for the vigilante, who has yet to be caught. Police are insisting the vigilante is highly dangerous.</line>

    <line id="171897">Public outcry is so extreme that police have opened a new hotline dedicated exclusively to calls about the vigilante. They are asking viewers to use the number if they have any information about this dangerous criminal. Meanwhile, the man's motivation remains a mystery. Police are still searching for a pattern--a way to determine where the man may strike next, but so far they claim his actions have been ... "chaotic."</line>
    <line id="171898">The citizens of Chicago have had enough. Recent polls show that a majority of people want the vigilante to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We dug a little deeper to find out just what that might entail. Police hesitate to release any details, however, they do acknowledge the vigilante is linked to several murders and would almost certainly be looking at a life sentence in prison.</line>

    <line id="171908">Social media is buzzing about the vigilante. One poster wrote: "The vigilante must be stopped. He is a menace to the city." That's just one of many posts decrying Chicago's self-appointed crime fighter. Several other words are popping up frequently on social media - "anarchist," "terrorist," and even "revolutionary." The questions remain -- what is he revolting against, and why? So far, the vigilante has left no messages behind and police are baffled by his crime spree.</line>
    <line id="171909">The growing anger towards the vigilante has pressured the Chicago PD to issue a statement: "Under no circumstances should citizens intervene or try to subdue the vigilante. Instead, notify police immediately." The CPD has provided a way to do just that with their anonymous tip line, now active around the clock. Reports have already begun to pour in and authorities assure us they are following up on every one.</line>

    <line id="171926">Social media is buzzing about Chicago's vigilante. One viewer wrote the following: "Leave the vigilante alone! He's making more of a difference in this city than the entire Chicago police department!"</line>

This initiative is in response to the growing demands from the population to apprehend this dangerous criminal. Now that the man has become an ongoing embarrassment to both the Police Department and the ctOS, can we expect an even bigger police response? Authorities assure us that they're considering all options, though they did not elaborate on what exactly that could mean.</line>
    <line id="171977">Violence spreads in the streets as the vigilante continues his destructive crime spree. Could the public outrage at this criminal be the cause of an unexpected spike in Chicago police recruits? If so, what does that say about the ctOS, which was intended to lessen crime in Chicago. Will manpower succeed where technology is failing? Perhaps, but they'll have to catch the vigilante first. For now, the man remains untraceable.</line>
    <line id="171979">Pearce. Manage to make public enemy #1 yet?</line>
    <line id="171980">The public debate continues about Chicago's vigilante. People are polarized on the subject, either praising or condemning the man's actions.</line>
    <line id="171981">The Fox: friend or foe? Our street interviews indicate that everyone has an answer, but no one is able to agree on just what that answer is.</line>
    <line id="171982">As always, we encourage our viewers to share their thoughts on our website. One viewer had this to say: "I don't know where I stand on this vigilante thing. The pros and the cons are more or less equal, as far as I'm concerned."</line>

    <line id="171998">Citizens remain conflicted about the vigilante and his impact on law and order in Chicago. While there are many vocal supporters and detractors, there are just as many who don't know what to make of this mysterious man.</line>
    <line id="171999">As the manhunt for the vigilante continues, the public perception of the alleged crime fighter remains mixed. We may have to wait and see what The Fox does next before the city comes to a consensus.</line>

    <line id="172391">Commonwealth Hotel</line>
    <line id="172392">It must've been quite the collection of thieves and underworld types on the floors of the Commonwealth. The infamous John Dillinger roamed these plush carpeted halls. In 1933 Dr. Harold Cassidy and Dr. Wilhelm Loeser resided at the Commonwealth, and were gracious enough to perform plastic surgery on Dillinger in their rooms.</line>
    <line id="172393">Lipstick Killer - Ross Crime Scene</line>
    <line id="172394">A summer day 1945, police knew when they arrived that this wasn't any ordinary burglary gone wrong. Josephine Ross had been repeatedly stabbed, the killer then bathed her and taped her wounds with surgical tape. Her head was wrapped in a dress. Strands of black hair were found clutched in her hand as she had desperately attempted to fend off her attacker. No one was ever convicted of her death.</line>
    <line id="172395">Lipstick Killer - Brown Crime Scene</line>
    <line id="172396">Winter 1945. Inside a small brownstone walk-up with old world charm, Frances Brown was found shot and brutally stabbed – the knife still in her neck, left naked in the bathtub. Her wounds washed and taped and her nightgown was wrapped around her head. Some criminal experts believe that these are the early killings of the later famous Los Angeles murder known as Black Dahlia.</line>
    <line id="172397">Lipstick Killer - Degnan Crime Scene</line>
    <line id="172398">January 1946, 6-year-old Suzanne Degnan was found dismembered  and scattered throughout the local sewers. Various witnesses mentioned seeing a man between 35-40 years of age, but to get a quick arrest, police honed in on 17 year old petty burglar, William George Heirens. Though he confessed, Heirens later claimed it was because of police brutality. Heirens died in prison on March 5th, 2012.</line>
    <line id="172399">The Sausage Vat Murder</line>
    <line id="172400">1897 Adolph Luetgart made his successful sausage factory the scene of his crime when he murdered his wife, Louisa. Investigators found a skull and a gold ring with the initials, L.L., in a factory vat. Though officially charged with burning his wife, rumors persisted that she had been ground into sausage. This caused sausage sales to decline and ultimately put the factory out of business. </line>
    <line id="172401">St. Valentine's Day Massacre</line>
    <line id="172402">George “Bugs” Moran headquartered his North Side Gang in a garage at this address. Capone had considered the Moran gang a thorn in his side for years. But Capone was out of town when five gangsters disguised as police entered the garage and lined the North Side Gang against the wall. The seven men were found with over 100 bullets riddled through their bodies.</line>
    <line id="172403">St. Valentine's Day Massacre Lookout</line>
    <line id="172404">Bugs Moran wasn't in the garage when someone gave the signal to machine-gun the North Side Gang members against the brick wall. While Moran was grateful that the shooters had mistaken small time racketeer, Albert Weinshank, for Moran, poor Albert wouldn't have seen it that way.</line>
    <line id="172405">Murder Castle</line>
    <line id="172406">The 1893 World's Fair was the perfect bait for Dr. Henry Howard Holmes (aka Herman Mudgett) to lure his estimated 200+ victims to his front door. Holmes built the 60 room, 3-story building with secret passageways, trap doors and chutes. Holmes advertised for tourists and staff. These unwary visitors and employees checked in and never left. The building burned down in 1895. Holmes was convicted and executed in 1896.</line>
    <line id="172407">Sheridan Wave Club</line>
    <line id="172408">Owned by George “Bugs” Moran and Julian “Potatoes” Kaufman of the Irish North Side Gang, the Sheridan Wave Club catered to an exclusive high-roller clientele. It's rumored the police took 10% of the house profits. Needless to say, this club was very lucrative for the gang. Facing public pressure over the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the police Commissioner ordered a raid and the closure of the club for good.</line>
    <line id="172409">O'Banion's Flower Shop</line>
    <line id="172410">Owned by Irish mob boss Dean O'Banion, his flower shop served as the gang's headquarters. O'Banion himself made and sent the floral arrangements for mobster funerals. And it was just such an occasion when gunmen walked in. Six direct shots dropped O'Banion in a heartbeat. O'Banion's funeral had one of the largest turnouts of any in Chicago's history with flowers from his shop.</line>
    <line id="172411">St. Jude Police League</line>
    <line id="172412">1932: In the midst of the Great Depression, Prohibition, and the reign of Al Capone, The Chicago Police Department founded the St. Jude Police League, a charitable organization that honors police officers killed in the line of duty and supports their families. Two decades later, the St. Jude Police League Memorial March was initiated. The parade, dedicated to remembering fallen state and city police officers, has since become an annual tradition.</line>
    <line id="172413">Seventh Federal Bank</line>
    <line id="172414">It's a grand old building that's seen its share of thieves. One day in September 1933, bank robber Alvin Karpis used machine-guns and smoke bombs to rob the bank. With five sacks loaded in the car, Karpis made his getaway right into a head-on collision. When an officer stopped to investigate the accident, Karpis gunned the officer down and stole a car. The escape took Karpis to a south side hideout where he discovered the sacks were full of mail.</line>
    <line id="172415">Raven Building</line>
    <line id="172416">The Great Fire of 1871 consumed most of Chicago, including City Hall. The Raven Building became the temporary home of the municipal government while Chicago was rebuilt. In 1958, young Commissioner J. Sallik was closing in on a union scam with the Chicago South Club when he was gunned down just outside the Raven Building. No one has ever been charged with the crime.</line>
    <line id="172417">Cree Theater</line>
    <line id="172418">The Cree Theater was built in 1910, making it one of the oldest venues in the city. Famous for being one of the last remaining stacked or “double-decker” performing arts theaters in the world, it's also infamous for a brief conversion to screen soft-core pornographic films. It was restored in 1990 after being acquired by the city's heritage department. Don't worry, they reupholstered everything.</line>
    <line id="172419">The Sands</line>
    <line id="172420">What do you do if you're a mayor in 1850 with a criminal shantytown in your beloved city? If you're mayor Long John Wentworth, you lure the residents of The Sands to a fake horse race and then have your men tear all the shacks down. I'm not sure how long it took for the prostitutes, gamblers, thieves and murderers to figure out the horses weren't racing, but when they got back they started one helluva riot. Just when the situation could be described as really bad, someone lit a match. The entire area - roughly the size of a horse track - was flattened into a smoking rubble.</line>
    <line id="172421">Lombardo Murder</line>
    <line id="172422">September 7, 1928, thirty-six year old Antonio Lombardo and his bodyguards were confronted by two well dressed men carrying guns.
Lombado started running across Madison but didn't make it far. Gunned down in broad daylight. He hit the pavement face down in front of the office crowd.
Lombardo was a trusted advisor, and third man, to Al Capone. It's believed that Bugs Moran leader of the North Side Gang had issued the hit on Lombardo knowing this would be a blow to Capone.
As with so many of these mob hits, the real gunmen were never apprehended.</line>
    <line id="172423">Randolph Street Subway Terminal</line>
    <line id="172424">Alfred Jake Lingle, crime reporter for the Chicago Tribune, liked to play middleman between Capone, the mob and police. With Jake demanding more and more compensation and suddenly being a dangerous liability with so much information in his noggin, somebody decided that Jake needed a bullet there instead. The murder of Jake Lingle goes unsolved with only one clue… the murder weapon was later tied to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.</line>
    <line id="172425">Chicago Eastland Disaster</line>
    <line id="172426">July 24th, 1915: The Western Electric Company chartered a steamer, the Eastland, to take their employees and families to a picnic in Michigan. Recent regulations had the steamer retrofitted with lifeboats. Unfortunately this extra weight made the Eastland top heavy. Not 20ft from shore and only fifteen minutes into the trip, the steamer rolled over and sank. 841 passengers and 4 crew members drowned.</line>
    <line id="172427">2nd Regiment Armory</line>
    <line id="172428">Not far from here is the former site of the 2nd Regiment Armory. We could not get the legal rights to place a plaque on the actual site, but this is close enough. 845 bodies from the Eastland ferry disaster were brought to the Armory until they could be identified by their relatives. To this day people claim to hear sobbing, whispering, and doors slamming, and a phantom woman dressed in early 1900s attire has been seen drifting through the site.</line>
    <line id="172429">Saga Theater</line>
    <line id="172430">In 1934 Public Enemy Number #1, John Dillinger, was gunned down by federal officers nearby. Steps away from the exit, Dillinger caught on that the authorities were surrounding him and so he bolted. He was fatally shot in the neck and eye and died instantly in the nearby alley. Anxious souvenir hunters reportedly leapt onto the body dabbing pieces of clothing into Dillinger's blood.</line>
    <line id="172431">Bloody Maxwell Police Station</line>
    <line id="172432">Built in 1888 as an architectural fortress, the 7th District Police Station was deep in the heart of the Terror District where the criminal element festered. More police were killed in the line of duty in this area, and in this era, than any other in the history of the Chicago police department. Al Capone and other famous mobsters, such as Sam Giancana, were "guests" of Bloody Maxwell at various points in their criminal careers.</line>
    <line id="172433">John A. Walsh Public School</line>
    <line id="172434">They learn young... on the border between two warring gangs, Irishers and the Immigrant Bohemians, battles were waged on and off school property by kids ranging in age from 10-15 years. These battles resulted in numerous deaths. In a final bloody battle on December, 1905, scores of kids on either side faced off. When police finally intervened the area was strewn with casualties. The number of fatalities was never recorded.</line>
    <line id="172435">Shotgun Man</line>
    <line id="172436">Between 1910 and 1911, an unidentified man, referred to as "Shotgun Man" gunned down 15 Italian immigrants. Believed to be an assassin working for the Black Hand extortionist gangs, Shotgun Man murdered those who refused to pay up. He disappeared as quickly as he appeared.</line>
    <line id="172437">Deadman's Corner</line>
    <line id="172438">Few cities can claim one, let alone more than one, corner so notoriously named. A few blocks from Bloody Maxwell is an intersection known as Deadman's Corner. The slum area was the location for a series of fatal shootouts that had taken place here. A swamp of criminals, this location was reportedly where more police were killed by thugs than any other in Chicago's long criminal history.</line>
    <line id="172439">Bootlegging Factory</line>
    <line id="172440">In the 1920s, this warehouse was the central location for production and distribution of bootleg alcohol run by the savage crime family known as the Genna brothers. Competing against the North Side Gang for the liquor trade, a gang war erupted. In 1925, three of the brothers were gunned down in separate gunfights against the North Siders and police. The other brothers subsequently fled Chicago. No one really knows how many brothers there were in total.</line>
    <line id="172441">Aiello's Bakery</line>
    <line id="172442">It was Aiello's Bakery that provided the mob with sugar for their bootleg stills. Feeling the pinch from all sides of the mob invading his successful import businesses and wanting to be top boss himself, Aiello tried multiple times to take out Capone including poisoning. Aiello managed to stay alive while also being an FBI informant for a while. Capone finally ordered a hit on Aiello in October 1930. So much for ambition.</line>
    <line id="172443">Stockyards</line>
    <line id="172444">Known as “Packing Town” located in a large stretch of land on the South side, the Stockyards were founded in 1863 and grew to 130 miles of track producing 80% of the meat consumed in the U.S. by 1923. In 1919, when workers went on strike for better pay, a race riot broke out. Police killed 4 while attempting to get the crowd under control.</line>
    <line id="172445">Big Jim Colosimo's Cafe</line>
    <line id="172446">Before Torrio and before Capone, Big Jim Colosimo ran Chicago's Outfit. Big Jim controlled the South Side's hundreds of gambling saloons, opium dens and brothels from 1902 to 1920. Big Jim sealed his fate when he refused to expand the business into illegal liquor smuggling. Johnny Torrio, anxious to expand the business, ordered a hit on his boss. Colosimo was gunned down in his own establishment.</line>
    <line id="172447">Hit on Johnny Torrio</line>
    <line id="172448">In 1925, George “Bugs” Moran and Hymie Weiss targeted Johnny Torrio after their mob boss, Dean O'Banion, was gunned down in his flower shop. In revenge, Moran and Weiss pulled up behind Torrio and his wife as they were about to enter their home. Blasted with shotgun fire in his gut, chest and face, Torrio remarkably managed to survive. Immediately afterward, Torrio signed over all of his control to Al Capone. He retired to Italy.</line>
    <line id="172449">Four Deuces</line>
    <line id="172450">Taken over by mob boss Johnny Torrio and Al Capone in 1922, this less than friendly establishment had already seen its share of shootings between drunken gamblers. Rumor had it that the place was equipped with a trap door down to the basement where deadbeats were treated to some gangster hospitality. No tipping required.</line>
    <line id="172451">Hawthorne Hotel</line>
    <line id="172452">The Hawthorne was famous in its day for being one of Al Capone's many headquarters. January 17th, 1926: Al Capone's men decide to give their boss a birthday present. The gang kidnapped jazz musician Fats Waller and brought him to play for Capone's birthday party. Waller played for three days straight with a gun to his head. Waller later said he was paid "really well."</line>
    <line id="172453">The Murder Market</line>
    <line id="172454">This once-thriving market was once a place where the common-folk could rub shoulders with the privileged, or as I like to call them--the mafia. You could strike up a conversation with Machine Gun Jack while waiting on your cold cuts. For a lot of people, it was the closest they'd ever get to celebrity. Unfortunately, it also got them close to one of the worst  gang shootouts in Chicago history. Thirty-two people checked out that day and the only coupons used were toe-tags. </line>
    <line id="172455">Lexington Hotel</line>
    <line id="172456">The Lexington was Capone's last stop before he was arrested in 1931 for tax evasion. Built in 1892 as a standard luxury hotel, when Capone and his gang moved in they gave the Lex a shooting gallery, a vault and secret passageways leading to taverns and brothels. They were meant to be an easy escape from the police and other potential threats. But not even secret tunnels can save a guy from the IRS.</line>
    <line id="172457">Tremont House Hotel</line>
    <line id="172458">Built in 1833, the Tremont was designed to be one of the first luxurious hotels in Chicago, and was subsequently rebuilt 3 times. Abraham Lincoln stayed here. Criminal John Stone lingered around the 2nd floor hall off and on for a few years until he was arrested and convicted for rape in 1840. Stone has the dubious distinction of being the first man to be executed in the city of Chicago.</line>
    <line id="172459">Desplaines Street Police Station</line>
    <line id="172460">October 1893: the very troubled Patrick Prendergast went to the home of Chicago Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., and shot the mayor three times before escaping. Shortly after, he turned himself in to police at the Des Plaines station. Prendergast's motive was a meandering tale. His lawyer attempted to have him declared insane but the attempts failed. Prendergast was executed by hanging in 1894.</line>
    <line id="172461">Haymarket Square Riot</line>
    <line id="172462">In 1886, a protest by workers demanding better wages erupted into a tragedy when an unknown person threw a bomb at the police. This sparked a shootout, resulting in the deaths of 8 police officers and an unknown number of protesters. Four men were convicted of murdering the officers and were executed. However, it was never proven any of them had thrown the bomb.</line>
    <line id="172463">Secret Six</line>
    <line id="172464">It took the shooting of a business contractor in 1930 here to set Chicago's influential businessmen after Capone. It's these six men who hired Eliot Ness to stop Capone once and for all. To this day not much is known of the six. They aided investigations where they could by providing funds and expertise in business and taxes. They operated their own speakeasy to spy on the criminals.</line>
    <line id="172465">The Fort Dearborn Massacre</line>
    <line id="172466">August 15, 1812: American soldiers at Fort Dearborn, led by Captain Heald, offered to pay members of the Potawatomi tribe in weapons, liquor, and money to escort them to Fort Wayne. At the last minute, Heald ordered their surplus goods to be destroyed, going back on their deal. The Potawatomi retaliated by attacking the Americans as they left Fort Dearborn. On this site, 26 Americans, including 12 children, were killed, while another 28 were taken prisoner.</line>
    <line id="172467">Home of Samuel "Nails" Morton</line>
    <line id="172468">This site was the home of Samuel “Nails” Morton, a Jewish gangster who served in World War One before establishing his life of crime in Chicago. Morton was a member of the North Side Gang along with Dean O'Banion. He reportedly shot two police officers for interrupting him as he ate dinner. Imagine what he would've done to telemarketers.</line>
    <line id="172469">Meadowmoore Dairies</line>
    <line id="172470">This park was once the site of Meadowmoore Dairies, opened in 1932 by Al Capone three months before he was incarcerated. Capone, along with his right-hand man Murray Humphreys, were keen to get into the milk business upon learning they could get a greater markup for milk than alcohol. Capone famously remarked to his associates, “we've been in the wrong business all along!”</line>
    <line id="172471">Tackle Shop</line>
    <line id="172472">In the last five years, this inconspicuous tackle shop has been subjected to more police raids than any single business in all of Chicago within the same timeframe. While these raids have never revealed anything incriminating, local authorities have repeatedly claimed that the shop is the nexus of a burgeoning chapter of the Chicago South Club. The Mayor of Pawnee has denied any gang presence in Pawnee, but it might be best to buy your lures and reels elsewhere.</line>

    <line id="173348">The Pawnee Murder House</line>
    <line id="173349">August 1988: Pawnee police arrested homeowner Candy Amos for the murder of her husband, then-mayor Sandford Amos. Mayor Amos, who was openly abusive towards his wife and had recently been indicted on charges of corruption, was not mourned upon his death. Although Candy Amos would die in prison one year later, she quickly became a local legend, a symbol of female empowerment and revolution.</line>
    <line id="173350">Home of Lloyd Pinkerton</line>
    <line id="173351">This was the home of Lloyd Pinkerton, a community leader and founder of the Black Viceroys. Pinkerton arrived in Chicago in 1960 and quickly became involved in the betterment of The Wards. His group, the Black Viceroys, raised funds for local schools, organized meal programs, and advocated civil rights. Growing racial tensions led to Pinkerton's murder in 1966 and transformed the Black Viceroys from community organizers into a violent gang.</line>
    <line id="173352">V Alley</line>
    <line id="173353">February 1971: the Viceroys had spent the last year in a turf war with an upstart gang known as P.D.C. - gang violence came to a head in this alley, when 5 unnamed Viceroys ambushed and killed 15 key members of P.D.C. The massacre was covered by every major newspaper in the state, and brought the Viceroys legitimacy and power, while the remaining members P.D.C. went into hiding or joined the V's.</line>
    <line id="173354">Birthplace of the Chicago South Club</line>
    <line id="173355">This parking garage is the site of an insignificant bar known for one notable event. According to his autobiography, Henry "Mick" O'Brien met here with other Irish "businessmen" in 1951. They decided to pool their resources and reclaim power and territory from the fledgling Chicago Outfit. In honor of the North Side Gang, whose reign ended with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, these individuals quickly named themselves the Chicago South Club.</line>
    <line id="173356">Hanson Park</line>
    <line id="173357">As the Chicago South Club spread, their reach inevitably met the resistance of the Chicago Outfit and other outlying gangs. One act of retaliation took place near this park, and while details of the attack have never been agreed upon - whether the Chicago Outfit was responsible, how many Club members were killed – only one survivor was seen fleeing the scene. Lucky guy.</line>

    <line id="174519">For the past year DedSec has been in a rivalry with a former member named G1gg1L3s. 
He'll hack them, they'll hack him back, you know how it goes.</line>
    <line id="174520">So I take it that for this round, G1gg1L3s has gotten the upper hand.</line>
    <line id="174521">He slipped a zero-day virus into their network and managed to get the identities of multiple DedSec members. He says he'll go public with the information if DedSec doesn't decipher two encrypted messages. They've already managed to decode the first message. It says, "Congratulations, you’ve found my secret message. You can handle yourselves online, but what about offline? Get a new point of view to find me and your identities will stay safe. QR much?”</line>

    <line id="174804">He's earned the nickname, The Fox, for outsmarting criminals, and Chicago loves him for it. Our station is flooded with praise for the vigilante's actions. Keep your comments rolling in.</line>
    <line id="174805">After a number of criminal arrests by the police, people believe the real credit belongs to The Fox. Our station is flooded with praise for the vigilante. So if you're watching... Chicago says, "keep up the good work."</line>
    <line id="174807">Chicago Police have issued a warrant for the Vigilante, Aiden Pearce. However, Chicago citizens are cheering Pearce on. With so much citizen support, police are having a hard time getting any tips on his whereabouts.</line>
    <line id="174808">WKZ-TV's recent opinion poll shows that people are rallying on the side of vigilante suspect, Aiden Pearce. People are even offering to protect Pearce. However, Chicago PD warns that doing so could lead to criminal charges.</line>
    <line id="174809">Our recent opinion poll has people overwhelmingly against the vigilante. Many cite the wake of destruction he's left behind as he battles gang violence across the city. Support for the one-man crusade has recently dropped as many reports of collateral damage continue to pour in. The CPD noted that this is exactly why vigilantism does not work. The police are properly, professionally trained to fight crime and a vigilante is simply a criminal.</line>
    <line id="174810">Chicago citizens are furious that police have yet to arrest the vigilante known as The Fox. According to our recent poll, people consider the vigilante to be as big a threat to safety as street gangs and organized crime. Businesses near reported vigilante sightings have taken a hit as civilians try to avoid getting caught in the crossfire and the owners are demanding action. In the meantime, Police remind us that the crime tip line is always open.</line>
    <line id="174811">Chicago citizens want police to put an end to the vigilante. Some are even going so far as to equate his acts to domestic terrorism. His attacks seem to be motivated by some sense of justice, but some of his actions have led to major damages, costing the city a hefty sum. Police are encouraging the vigilante to turn himself in. They promise to listen to his grievances and, if he has information that leads to criminal arrests, they will follow through. Leave it to the professionals, they urge. But for now, the professionals are still left without any answers.</line>
    <line id="174812">Chicago residents are sounding off on the vigilante and they're not happy. Social media sites show that a vast majority of posters are against the actions of this dangerous individual. One poster asks, "What's the point if you're hurting innocent people along the way? This guy's not a vigilante, he's just another gangster in a gangster war." Chicago has a historical obsession with larger-than-life criminals, however, this new vigilante is quickly losing public support.</line>

If you're not picky and you just want a no-frills piece, this 9mm European import fits the bill. They're as common as v-necks on hipsters, and about as impressive. It can still ruin someone's day if you're a good shot. </line>
    <line id="174814">A stern warning from the Chicago police chief to the vigilante: "You are not above the law." Fuelled by recent vigilante actions and complaints from angry citizens, the police department has vowed to not rest until the vigilante is arrested. But for some, that raises the question -- how much of the police force is now dedicated to finding one man and what strain does that put on regular police service? I think we can all agree the sooner the vigilante is brought to justice, the better.</line>
    <line id="174815">Are you angry over the vigilante? You're not alone. A recent WKZ opinion poll shows that a majority of people disapprove of the vigilante's actions. And police are pleased with the new trend. Sgt. David Walt explains, "In a world now fueled by social media, a vigilante is an especially dangerous character. We don't want to see any 'me-toos' spring up, because we'll most likely see them locked up or on a morgue slab. This man is anything but a hero."</line>
    <line id="174817">Well now that we're able to put a name to the vigilante, does that change people's opinions? Not if the recent polls are true. Chicago citizens want Aiden Pearce thrown in jail for life. Several "hunting Aiden Pearce" sites have gone live since the reveal and Police have asked us to remind everyone there's a line that cannot be crossed. Engaging in vigilantism to catch the vigilante is only continuing the criminal cycle and there will be no tolerance. However, Police encourage all citizens to take advantage of the anonymous tip line.</line>
    <line id="174818">Vigilante Aiden Pearce has struck again. He's been terrorizing citizens in the name of justice for months now and people have had enough. Some are even referring to Pearce as a terrorist. But does Aiden Pearce fit the profile of a terrorist? That's not entirely clear. He has not attached himself to any political movement and his targets appear to be criminals themselves. However, the CPD insists that their job is to apprehend the man, not to label him. Everything else will be left to the justice system.</line>

Contrary to what you see in movies and TV, you actually do have to aim a shotgun. You don't need to be pin-point accurate, but you need to be in the general area of what you want to kill. Just keep that in mind the first time you get your hands on one of these pump-action boom sticks.</line>

Okay, so you played "that game" when you were a kid and now you really want a double-barreled shotgun. I get it. And yes, the short barrel makes for a wider spread at the cost of range. Just remember that you only get two shots before you gotta reload. I don't know about you, but I like to have more than just two giggles at a time.</line>

Apparently someone decided the AK-47 wasn't deadly enough and turned it into a semi-automatic shotgun. Sure, you lose out on range here, but having 12 shotgun rounds ready to go at any time is pretty sweet.

So you need something that sends a lot of lead downrange but you don't have a lot of cash. The SMG-11 works.

Reach out and touch someone. Actually, it's more like, reach out and double-tap someone. Thing is, you really would need to do a double-tap. As far as sniper rifles go, this one lacks the hitting power to give you a reliable one-shot kill. Keep that in mind, or don't, it's all funny to me.</line>

I just heard a rumor that Badboy17 is a tatted-up Quebecoise native who looks like she just kicked a hornet's nest.  I'd like to write more, but right now I need to go back to every message I've ever sent to BB17 and see if said anything sexist to her in the past. :-(

These ctOS nerve centers are the backbone of ctOS. Accordingly, they're virtually impossible to hack remotely, so anyone looking to get illicit ctOS access will need to find a way inside.

History lesson time. In the early days of ctOS, Blume kept test pods all over Chicago. These prototype control centers were monitored 24/7 while all the bugs got worked out, so they have amenities like beds and showers. Blume still keeps them around nowadays as a back-up system. Bet a night in one of these would be worth a giggle.</line>

Just keep an eye open in case something funky goes down.</line>

    <line id="178472">Ok, we're uploading the data. Everyone stay alert.</line>
    <line id="178478">We need you to locate and mark a series of vulnerable ctOS terminals. You don't have a lot of time to find them, so move fast.</line>
    <line id="178479">Locate and confirm your target. Proceed to follow him until we can confirm our suspicions. Stay low --do not let your target, or the police, spot you. That's all you need to know.</line>
    <line id="178480">Your task is to find your targets and eliminate them. Nobody gets out alive-- understand? The client may have special requests if you feel like showing off.</line>
    <line id="178481">We need you to protect a ctOS station and ensure its firewall holds strong against rival hackers and gunmen.</line>
    <line id="178482">One of our high-value targets is in town. We need you to hack them and install a backdoor for us.</line>
    <line id="178489">We're aiming to control some extremely valuable data, but it's no small task. You and your team will need to retrieve and decrypt important files and then upload them to us through ctOS stations. Expect serious, armed opposition.</line>
    <line id="178496">We're after a specific data file, but it's heavily encrypted and highly contested. You will face rivals who will try to kill you and steal the file before you can get it to us.</line>

    <line id="178511">This is an anything-goes race to the finish line. We're not concerned about "fair play" or regulations, here - so please be creative.</line>
    <line id="178544">Still got laps to go in this race.</line>

    <line id="178546">Only just getting started here--we've got more laps ahead.</line>
    <line id="178547">We've still got laps to do, which means it's anybody's guess who will win.</line>

    <line id="178550">You ran a smart race. Well done.</line>

    <line id="178552">Sorry, but that performance doesn't even rank. Maybe next time.</line>
    <line id="178553">Oooh. Don't know what happened there, but that was not your best showing.</line>
    <line id="178554">Sorry, but you have to have losers if you're gonna have winners, right?</line>
    <line id="178555">Looks like you got smoked that time. Happens to the best of us.</line>
    <line id="178556">Damn! That was one hell of a run, my friend!</line>
    <line id="178557">What a race! I don't think anybody was ready for you.</line>
    <line id="178558">Jesus Christ, I wish I could drive like that. Well done.</line>
    <line id="178559">You blitzed them, man. They're going to feel that in the morning!</line>

    <line id="184561">Maurice? Are you at the meet now? I want you to clean up this mess with your brother today. Send him to that Russian. Tell him it's for a job.

    <line id="186937">While a statement from the Commissioner's office acknowledges the recent decline in criminal activity, the vigilante known as the Fox is only given the slightest praise for his crimefighting efforts. An anonymous source told our reporters that members of the police department are more enthusiastic about the vigilante than they are allowed to publicly disclose.</line>
    <line id="186938">And as the search continues for the vigilante known as the Fox, top brass in the Chicago Police Department are urging city and state governments to allow stricter penalties against those who commit crimes in the name of law and order. Anyone who follows in the Fox's footsteps will, quote, 
"be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."</line>
    <line id="186939">Police are finding it difficult to deny the impact the vigilante has made on the city of Chicago. Hackers, murderers, and illegal traffickers have been undone in the wake of the vigilante's rise to prominence, and analysts predict that the city will experience its lowest crime rate in decades.</line>

    <line id="187112">I'll talk to him when I get home.</line>
    <line id="187113">Go easy on him, okay? He's still young.</line>
    <line id="187114">Too young to be swearing like that, especially at you. He needs to learn respect.</line>
    <line id="187115">I made him cry, I think he's learned his lesson.</line>
    <line id="187116">You ever seen a not-scary clown?</line>
    <line id="187117">Hey, I heard about Maxie. I just wanted to let you know how sorry I am.</line>
    <line id="187118">Naw man, it's actually really good. I love that bulgogi shit.</line>
    <line id="187119">Look at this Joe. Results came in.</line>
    <line id="187120">For real? You bullshitting me.</line>
    <line id="187121">Come on, he's my brother. He likes being helpful.</line>
    <line id="187122">Now that I think of it, no, I haven't.</line>
    <line id="187123">Why do people still hire clowns for birthday parties?</line>
    <line id="187124">Especially for an adult.</line>
    <line id="187125">Worst party ever.</line>
    <line id="187126">I got a friend looking after him now. Well, it's the chick next door to me. I had to come to work. Is it serious? Should I bring him in?</line>
    <line id="187127">Thanks, man. She was a beautiful dog.</line>
    <line id="187128">How are you doing?</line>
    <line id="187129">Not too good. The one I really feel bad for is Mugsy. He knows his buddy isn't around anymore.</line>
    <line id="187130">Well... you know I'm here for you.</line>
    <line id="187131">I'm not much for ethnic foods.</line>
    <line id="187132">And?</line>
    <line id="187133">No sir. You are one of five randomly selected winners. Congratulations.</line>
    <line id="187134">WTF. Why's Blume giving us orders?</line>
    <line id="187135">How much does he weigh again?</line>
    <line id="187136">Dunno. Eighty, eighty-five pounds.</line>
    <line id="187137">And it was milk chocolate that he ate?</line>
    <line id="187138">Yeah. I think so. Yeah, for sure it was milk chocolate. Why? Is that better or worse?</line>
    <line id="187139">Better. If your dog ate dark chocolate then we'd be pretty worried. Given his size and the amount of milk chocolate he should be okay.</line>
    <line id="187140">Should I bring him in? I feel like I should. In case.</line>
    <line id="187141">You can if you want to. But I don't think you need to worry about him.</line>
    <line id="187142">I didn't know chocolate was poisonous to them.Maybe I'll bring him in. When I'm done with my shift.</line>
    <line id="187143">That's no excuse, you gotta try this place out man. It's fucking delicious! You get this grill in the middle of your table, all the meat you can eat, and hot-ass Asian honeys everywhere!</line>
    <line id="187144">Okay, okay, I'll give it a shot. But I'm not eating kimchi.</line>
    <line id="187145">He'll talk.</line>
    <line id="187146">He's a pain in the ass.</line>
    <line id="187147">Knock it off. My brother offered to get you the deal on the speakers and he did. What's the problem now?</line>
    <line id="187148">Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's that they're shit. He skimmed more money off the cost for himself than they were worth. And I'm sick of this, 'I know a guy' shit. He doesn't know anyone. I know people. And none of them would stand on the sidewalk with him.</line>
    <line id="187149">What fucking bee buzzed up your ass today? Stop insulting my brother because he's trying to make a few extra bucks.</line>
    <line id="187150">Camera phone activated</line>
    <line id="187151">Bedbug's right. Iraq is gonna screw us.</line>
    <line id="187152">The fuck is wrong with you?</line>
    <line id="187153">You see Iraq's server room? It'll destroy Quinn.</line>
    <line id="187154">Iraq will own Chicago soon. Fuck Bedbug.</line>
    <line id="187155">I hear DedSec contacted Iraq.</line>
    <line id="187156">Is true</line>
    <line id="187157">They looking for some kinda data. Tryin to team up.</line>
    <line id="187158">Fuck that shit. They wanna take down Blume.</line>
    <line id="187159">Iraq says he can take down everyone.</line>
    <line id="187160">Uh huh. What would my mileage be again?</line>
    <line id="187161">Hey now, you been to my house, remember? Did you see anything that was contraband?</line>
    <line id="187162">The shakes stopped, like you said.</line>
    <line id="187163">One eighty three.</line>
    <line id="187164">That good?</line>
    <line id="187165">This model beats all others in the price comparison, sir.</line>
    <line id="187166">Is it fast? What's the pick up in these? I got a buddy who has some eco compact and it's mileage is great but it can't pass worth a damn.</line>
    <line id="187167">Right. This model isn't your average compact electric car. Swing by and take it for a test drive.</line>
    <line id="187168">I remember. That kid was fucking pissed off. He was ready to beat your ass.</line>
    <line id="187169">We do offer a comprehensive flood insurance plan.</line>
    <line id="187170">They say I got that HPV shit.</line>
    <line id="187171">Oh shit, you need to tell her.</line>
    <line id="187172">I did, she said that it's probably from her, though.</line>
    <line id="187173">No way. Did you ask her where she got it from?</line>
    <line id="187174">Aw, hell yeah. What did I get?</line>
    <line id="187175">An all expenses paid vacation to London for two. That means your flight and hotel will be covered and you'll also get a daily allowance for incidentals.</line>
    <line id="187176">Aw shit, I'm going to England motherfucker!</line>
    <line id="187177">Do you have a valid passport?</line>
    <line id="187178">How's that different from any other day?</line>
    <line id="187179">No, and I'm not accusing you of possessing contraband, but as your parole officer, I have to keep my eye on you at all times. Guys your age have a bad habit of recommitting once they're out.</line>
    <line id="187180">Naw man, not me, man. I did my time, and I don't want to do no more. You don't have to worry about me.</line>
    <line id="187181">I will, anyway. That's my job.</line>
    <line id="187182">It ain't stupid. Why's it stupid?</line>
    <line id="187183">Wait. What? Why do I have to pick that shit up?</line>
    <line id="187184">I'm gonna give you the cash. You go give it to him.</line>
    <line id="187185">What the hell I just told you boy, I don't want no insurance.</line>
    <line id="187186">We have very reasonable rates, and flooding is more common in Chicago than you may expect.</line>
    <line id="187187">What about insurance for getting shot, you guys got something for that?</line>
    <line id="187188">Didn't I tell you? Sounds like it hit you pretty easy, compared to when I quit.</line>
    <line id="187189">I honestly don't know what I'd do without you. You're a good friend and a beautiful person.</line>
    <line id="187190">Thanks. I'm glad we've been able to maintain a strong sponsor-sponsee relationship without being attracted to each other.</line>
    <line id="187191">Oh, yeah. For sure.</line>
    <line id="187192">Oh, hell yeah, they're the shit live! I would give anything to get a ticket.</line>
    <line id="187193">Who's paying for it? You? Get one of your brothers to teach you.</line>
    <line id="187194">I don't want none of them to know.</line>
    <line id="187195">Well, yeah. A Viceroy paying for driving lessons? Iraq's got all sorts of connections. He'll get you a license.</line>
    <line id="187196">Naw. It ain't that. I want this. You know? I want to learn how to drive properly.</line>
    <line id="187197">Sounds stupid to me, pal. Waste of dough.</line>
    <line id="187198">Ha, ah you got a point there.</line>
    <line id="187199">So you good? Still got that job?</line>
    <line id="187200">Yeah, uh, sure, I still got that job. It's all good.</line>
    <line id="187201">You're done with the Viceroys, right?</line>
    <line id="187202">Yeah man, for sure.</line>
    <line id="187203">Anything?</line>
    <line id="187204">Well, money, yeah</line>
    <line id="187205">Any amount of money?</line>
    <line id="187206">Shit I got a hundred fifty.</line>
    <line id="187207">Deal.</line>
    <line id="187208">So what's all this about?</line>
    <line id="187209">I'm so fucking bored. They got me watching some warehouse.</line>
    <line id="187212">The place has my biometric profile.</line>
    <line id="187213">I got fillings in my head that sing to their security team direct.</line>
    <line id="187214">The fuck you say?</line>
    <line id="187215">Your check bounced. We've got to have a serious talk in the morning.</line>
    <line id="187216">No way, that can't be possible! It's gotta be a mistake!</line>
    <line id="187217">I hope so. I really do. I don't want to have to evict you.</line>
    <line id="187218">You're the best man. It's your duty.</line>
    <line id="187219">My what?</line>
    <line id="187220">You take care of the groom duties.</line>
    <line id="187221">I didn't want to do any of this shit. I'm not picking up cucumber buns.</line>
    <line id="187222">Cumberbund.</line>
    <line id="187223">Don't care. I don't even want to know that word. I'm not doing this shit.</line>
    <line id="187224">We were able to recover your account.</line>
    <line id="187225">That's why you couldn't make it over tonight?</line>
    <line id="187226">Baby, I got a job to do!</line>
    <line id="187227">I know, but I really wanted to see you tonight.</line>
    <line id="187228">I'll head over first thing tomorrow. I promise.</line>
    <line id="187229">Aw sweet! What about all my loot?</line>
    <line id="187230">We have 2,000 gold on record, one set of epic armor and the limited edition Pegasus familiar. Is that correct?</line>
    <line id="187231">Yeah man. That's all of it. You guys really came through.</line>
    <line id="187232">Yeah, you wouldn't catch me dead in one of those things.</line>
    <line id="187233">That shit is nasty.</line>
    <line id="187234">You need to take your time with these things. You can't just rush in.</line>
    <line id="187236">That was just too much, you stepped over the line.</line>
    <line id="187237">I hear that wi-fi shit will give you cancer. We're just being bombarded by wi-fi signals everywhere we go.</line>
    <line id="187238">They're nice.</line>
    <line id="187239">They say it's good for you.</line>
    <line id="187240">But I love her, I know I do!</line>
    <line id="187242">He's an asshole! I called him out!</line>
    <line id="187243">It's all part of a ploy to whittle down the population. They started with cell phones that'll give you brain tumors and now they're on to wi-fi.</line>
    <line id="187244">You're the other hacker in the Merlaut.</line>
    <line id="187245">But you're sticking something up your nose. And what, does a bunch of shit just pour out the other side?</line>
    <line id="187246">First off, it's just salt water. Second, it helps me with my allergies.</line>
    <line id="187247">Sounds like water-boarding to me. No thanks.</line>
    <line id="187248">Come on ... Surprise, surprise</line>
    <line id="187249">You play a beautiful game but sometimes you still lose.</line>
    <line id="187250">Sorry, pal, new contract, kick it over.</line>
    <line id="187251">What?</line>
    <line id="187252">I only buy American, man.</line>
    <line id="187253">I used to be like that too, but those Germans sure know how to make a car.</line>
    <line id="187254">What ever happened to our national pride? Seriously.</line>
    <line id="187255">Okay, you're in love, that's great, but you can't just throw that in her face. Ease her into it, man.</line>
    <line id="187256">So I guess I shouldn't show her the ring?</line>
    <line id="187257">Jesus, were you born yesterday or something?</line>
    <line id="187260">Yes, he is an asshole, but he's also part of the group. He's got connections.</line>
    <line id="187261">So do I, I'm friends with you.</line>
    <line id="187262">You can't expect me to bail you out every time you get in trouble. You need to learn to tone it down.</line>
    <line id="187263">Yeah, they call me a criminal? They should go after the crooked bastards in all those corporations.</line>
    <line id="187264">Fuckin' CEOs. They get millions even when they screw up.</line>
    <line id="187265">It just ain't right.</line>

    <line id="187269">Aw, fucked up my back.</line>
    <line id="187270">Holding up. He's asking about you.</line>
    <line id="187271">Aw, man.</line>
    <line id="187272">You really should be here. If it's money, I can get you a train ticket--</line>
    <line id="187273">Nah, nah. Ain't even about the money.</line>
    <line id="187274">Then what? Tell me.</line>
    <line id="187275">I just don't know if I can forgive dude, man.</line>
    <line id="187276">It's the way you brawl, man. The way you fought last night, no wonder you pulled something or fucked something up. You should come to my gym. They got classes.</line>
    <line id="187277">You want me to be in a class with a bunch of sweaty old broads doing step exercises? The fuck you get your head on?</line>
    <line id="187278">Naw, man, boxing lessons. MMA, if you got the money. They can teach you form, fuckin' technique, man.</line>
    <line id="187279">MMA, huh?</line>
    <line id="187280">I'm telling you, it's true!</line>

    <line id="187290">Why do I have to? You're the one who owes him.</line>
    <line id="187291">Why? I'll tell you why. Because I'm afraid of his old lady. She's got crazy eyes. The way she stares and shit.</line>
    <line id="187292">She's got one them wandering eyes. Like crossed eyed, only it doesn't stay in one place. It drifts around in her head.</line>
    <line id="187293">See. You know what I'm talking about. Some crazy eyes in that damn lady's head. Drifting around. That's fucked up.</line>
    <line id="187294">I was hoping...</line>

    <line id="187302">I'm sorry can you please hold.</line>
    <line id="187303">Don't put me on hold again. I'm trying to make an appointment for my mom. Her feet are swollen up. I ain't seen blue feet before. You there?</line>
    <line id="187304">Hello?</line>
    <line id="187305">Hello?</line>
    <line id="187306">Now, sir, what is this regarding?</line>
    <line id="187307">Are you shitting me? I just told you.</line>
    <line id="187308">I am so sorry, sir. We're really swamped. Just bring her into the clinic.</line>
    <line id="187309">What are you, some kind of puritan?</line>
    <line id="187310">Listen, I lost a lot of good friends to the drink. I decided long ago I ain't going down that road.</line>
    <line id="187311">Ever heard of moderation?</line>
    <line id="187312">I'll still take you out to the bar. You can drink if you want, I'll just be having club soda. Is that alright with you?</line>
    <line id="187313">So did somebody put an offer on it?</line>
    <line id="187314">Didn't think I was gonna call, huh?</line>
    <line id="187315">Really? Why the hell would I want that?</line>
    <line id="187316">Come on, fam. You stole that shit.</line>
    <line id="187317">I said I'd be there.</line>
    <line id="187318">I used to enjoy hanging out with them, but now they just piss me off.</line>
    <line id="187319">Isn't that sweet? You're growing up!</line>
    <line id="187320">What the hell does that mean?</line>
    <line id="187321">About time, too! Babe, there's nothing wrong with maturing. This might be a turning point in your life. Get yourself out of the Club, already.</line>
    <line id="187322">Yeah, maybe.</line>
    <line id="187323">It seems it's turned into quite the bidding war. I'm really surprised. Like we always say in the real estate market, win some lose some. There's always another house, you know. Whatever your heart's desire and your wallet can manage.</line>
    <line id="187324">That's it, huh? That's what you guys always say?</line>
    <line id="187325">Pardon?</line>
    <line id="187326">It's just too long. Too wordy. It's kind of a bunch of things rolled into one. And the winning and losing shit. I don't think you guys should use that shit no more. Nu uh. Don't use that one.</line>
    <line id="187327">Uhh... okay. So will we be wanting to keep looking then?</line>
    <line id="187328">May as well, shit.</line>
    <line id="187330">He was hitting every ctOS center in town.</line>
    <line id="187331">Yeah. I hear he left Chicago.</line>
    <line id="187332">I thought vigilantes stayed in one place.</line>
    <line id="187333">Maybe he wants the ctOS center in Pawnee :p</line>
    <line id="187334">I'm saying no hard feelings.</line>
    <line id="187335">Sure, T-Bone. But you still don't get the truck.</line>
    <line id="187336">No problem, buckeroo! I'm just saying we're all good. </line>
    <line id="187337">I'm just saying all's good. So how's work?</line>
    <line id="187338">I don't got time to chat. You ain't getting the truck!</line>
    <line id="187339">Fuck me…You heard they just got hit, right?</line>
    <line id="187340">Bullshit! For real? </line>
    <line id="187341">How many more times do you want me to say I'm sorry?</line>
    <line id="187342">A lot more. You screwed up big time.</line>
    <line id="187343">Look, I gotta get back to work. We'll talk tomorrow.</line>
    <line id="187344">Aw...Goddamn canker sore.</line>
    <line id="187345">I don't know. I guess I thought you'd toss my number.</line>
    <line id="187346">Shit, I'd toss a gold brink in the river first, baby.</line>
    <line id="187347">Wow. That right? I see what I'm dealing with here. A real charmer, huh? Sweet talking the ladies.</line>
    <line id="187348">It's all I can do to keep them off of me. Even the old honeys love me. Especially them cougars.</line>
    <line id="187349">Always grabbing at your bottom.</line>
    <line id="187350">Everywhere I go.</line>
    <line id="187351">You pussy, just deal with it.</line>
    <line id="187352">I can't help but touch it with my tongue, and every time I do, it hurts!</line>
    <line id="187353">I'm aware of the trials and tribulations that come with having a canker sore.</line>
    <line id="187354">It really hurts!</line>
    <line id="187355">Well clearly you've never been shot in the foot before.</line>
    <line id="187356">Harsh words. I did not steal it. I liberated what was mine in the first place.</line>
    <line id="187357">You're nuts in the head, bro. I've seen her new dude. He's got a thigh for a neck. You don't want them problems.</line>
    <line id="187358">I can give as good as I get, brother. You have any idea how much dough I spent on my shit? He wants to play games he can buy his own damn console.</line>
    <line id="187359">Sorry babe, secret.</line>
    <line id="187360">Come on, I want to know what you do for a living.</line>
    <line id="187361">It's better that I don't.</line>
    <line id="187362">My kid is the easiest fucking person to please. Make him a grilled cheese sandwich, put in a movie, and he's happy as a clam.</line>
    <line id="187363">You don't think I earned my place? You think I got favors or advantages from anyone?</line>
    <line id="187364">Do you, uh, spend any quality time with him?</line>
    <line id="187365">Yeah, sometimes I drive him to school.</line>

    <line id="190428">[Silence 2]Violence erupted last night in Rossi-Fremont. The notorious neighborhood has suffered a wave of violence over the last few years as members of the Black Viceroys clash over gang leadership. Police officials see no end to the violence.</line>
    <line id="190429">[Silence 2]Mayor Rushmore is reaching out to Chicagoans after a hotly contested election. Despite anger in some quarters over his surprise victory, Rushmore insists he's working for all citizens and it's business as usual at City Hall.</line>
    <line id="190430">[Silence 2]It's been over 3 years since implementing the first ctOS station, and one year of city-wide operations. When planning for ctOS, Blume insisted its innovative network would save Chicagoans over $800 per household. Well after a full year of operation, the numbers are in. Over the past 12 months, Chicago households have saved an average $350. Blume points out that while less than half the original estimate, this still reflects a savings for all families thanks to ctOS.</line>
    <line id="190431">[Silence 2]Several members of the Chicago South Club were arrested following the police raid of a popular sports bar in Brandon Docks. No names have been released but the raid is already being criticized by watchdog groups for ignoring the organization's reputed leader, entrepreneur Dermot 'Lucky' Quinn.</line>
    <line id="190432">[Silence 2]Free wifi is here at last! Mayor Rushmore today confirmed that all of Chicago is now connected to a ctOS wifi network developed by Blume. Rushmore invited citizens to connect at their leisure anywhere in the city.</line>
    <line id="190433">[Silence 2]Are you up for a Digital Trip? That's the question you may get on the streets of Chicago as a new underground experience takes hold. Known as a Digital Trip, only one of these mind-altering experiences is currently available. But those in the know insist more will hit the streets very soon.</line>
    <line id="190434">[Silence 2]Known as "Digital Trips", these mind-altering experiences have hit the streets of Chicago. They're believed to change people's perceptions of the world around them. Though they're technically legal, don't expect that to last for long. City Officials are investigating and may push for bylaw restricting these digital adventures.</line>
    <line id="190440">[Silence 2]Does ctOS need a reboot? City Hall has been quick to downplay any problems with the ctOS network. This is despite numerous reports of malfunctioning systems throughout the city. Reports have come in of faulty traffic lights, power outages, and communications  to name a few.</line>
    <line id="190441">[Silence 2]Visitors to Chicago are being warned of street hustlers. Local residents are familiar with these shell game hustlers. Police caution city tourists to keep their money in their wallets, while many locals admit if you've got a good eye, you can earn a fast buck.</line>
    <line id="190442">[Silence 2]For the first time ever, the Windy City has been voted the most high tech city in America. Thanks to Mayor Rushmore's ctOS initiative, Chicago now boasts the most efficient and technologically advanced city in all the U S of A.</line>
    <line id="190443">[Silence 2.5]With the growing violence around Rossi-Fremont, Mayor Rushmore today issued a statement condemning the violence and announcing a special task force created to investigate the situation. Residents of the Wards were quick to respond calling the task force a PR stunt that will accomplish nothing.</line>
    <line id="190444">[Silence 2]Lucky Quinn is in the news again. This time for his charity work. Today, representatives of the Merlaut Hotel announced a fundraiser event coming to the hotel which is owned by Mr. Quinn. Mayor Rushmore is expected to open the event. No doubt, it will be a star-studded affair.</line>
    <line id="190445">[Silence 2]Unusual graffiti has appeared throughout the city and our own tech expert at WKZ speculates they are QR Codes designed to deliver unique content to the more tech-savvy citizens. So if you're up for an adventure, keep an eye out for these curious symbols.</line>
    <line id="190450">[Silence 2]The manhunt has intensified for the vigilante, Aiden Pearce. Chicago Police have distributed photos and surveillance footage of the man who has divided the city. Some call him a terrorist. Others, a hero. But the police and City Hall are determined to bring this man to justice. If you identify him, do not approach, do not engage. Call police at once.</line>
    <line id="190451">[Silence 2]Disturbing news in Chicago as the bodies of homeless women have been recovered in the streets. Police have released few details but are urging women to be cautious in their workday travels.</line>
    <line id="190452">[Silence 2]Noting a rise in high-powered assault weapons recovered by Chicago PD, city officials speculate that an organized weapons trade operation is active in Chicago. No arrests have been made but officials are confident they will shut down the operation in the coming weeks.</line>
    <line id="190472">[Silence 2]City officials are picking up the pieces from the shocking chaos brought on by a massive ctOS malfunction. The city experienced major power outages, bridge disruptions, and thousands of dollars in damages. While ctOS is back online, many are raising questions about the safety features needed to run a complex system in a major city.</line>
    <line id="190473">[Silence 2]A recent city poll shows a surprising majority of locals still supports a ctOS network. 56% of respondents strongly supported ctOS despite the city-wide malfunctions. Well, I guess that's the Chicago way.</line>
    <line id="190474">[Silence 2]Investigators of the ctOS service disruption have confirmed they have uncovered evidence that suggests the ctOS network may have been hacked. While initial reports suggested a flaw to the system, new evidence indicates tampering with the network. Anonymous sources suggest these hacks may have come from a single smart phone while city officials have called such speculation 'ridiculous'.</line>
    <line id="190475">[Silence 2]With Chicago still reeling from the shocking revelations of Rose Washington's murder, and Mayor Rushmore's subsequent death, there has been little appetite for politics or elections. But the city must move on and one name that's been floated about as a candidate for Chicago's interim mayor is Blume's VP of Communications, Charlotte Gardner. A familiar face around town, her supporters insist Ms. Gardner will restore integrity and trust to a city that sorely needs it.</line>
    <line id="190476">[Silence 2]Police are puzzled by the scene that greeted them at the abandoned lighthouse in Lake Michigan. The body of a white male was found on the gallery deck apparently killed by a short in the lamp light. Curiously, his pockets were stuffed with what police describe as mad scribblings.

    <line id="190827">I'm always thrilled to talk about ctOS.</line>
    <line id="190828">Great. Let's get into it. Why don't you explain what ctOS is? I mean, I think I get it, but it's kind of magical. </line>
    <line id="190829">The future is now, Dan.</line>
    <line id="190830">In a nutshell…</line>
    <line id="190831">ctOS is groundbreaking technology. We're promoting efficiency, comfort and safety.</line>
    <line id="190832">A smart city.</line>
    <line id="190833">Exactly.</line>
    <line id="190838">Charlotte, what makes ctOS smart?</line>
    <line id="190839">A city is a complex web of infrastructure maintenance and upkeep. Water, power, security, sewage, and transit flow. The antiquated system had these operating on their own, with disconnect from the rest of the city services. ctOS brings these systems online interconnecting them. Command centers monitor all of the services together. Thanks to ctOS, maintenance is easier and costs are lower.</line>
    <line id="190840">This makes the city efficient, as you say. But what about other issues, safety - privacy. Let's talk about privacy for a moment.</line>
    <line id="190841">Well, of course all privacy is respected. For instance, citizens can opt in to our integrated health services, where their medical records are available only to them and their health care provider.</line>
    <line id="190842">So only my doctor can see it, right?</line>
    <line id="190843">And only with your permission. All perfectly private.</line>
    <line id="190844">We have to take another short break.</line>
    <line id="190876">[Silence 2]Welcome back. I'm speaking with Charlotte Gardner, Blume Director of Public Relations.</line>
    <line id="190877">Alright, Charlotte. We were talking about privacy. There are cameras out there all over the city now. Everywhere. That's a ctOS addition. Right?</line>
    <line id="190878">That is tied to our safe city division. There is no data collection.</line>
    <line id="190879">I'm not sure I understand how that works.</line>
    <line id="190880">Well, it is proprietary information, but we can certainly assure you that any innocent citizen going about his or her day can feel safe. ctOS is watching over them, ensuring their privacy is protected, and ready to alert the police in case of any criminal activity.</line>
    <line id="190881">Charlotte, if the future is now, what's next?</line>
    <line id="190882">We're always working on new research and development. And right now we're exploring some exciting new ideas for ctOS and the smart city program. We'll have more announcements in the coming months.</line>

    <line id="190901">Right. Mr. Mayor, can we come back to your policies? I'd like to focus on the voter polls. Many of your detractors were crying foul over the poll data. Did the pendulum, as you call it, come as a surprise to you?</line>
    <line id="190902">Look. I understand that there's a transparency that people are looking for. But let's remember that the voters decided. Election day is the only poll that matters.</line>
    <line id="190905">We're here with Mayor Rushmore. Okay. Mister Mayor, let's talk about ctOS.</line>
    <line id="190908">Yes. Isn't it wonderful? ctOS network is what this city needed to go from great to phenomenal. It's what every city should be, and we're setting the standard.</line>
    <line id="190909">Some growing pains though. Am I right?</line>
    <line id="190910">No. Not at all. What you don't see is how much it helps this city. Cheaper, stronger, better.</line>

    <line id="190928">I knew some, what you call mobsters, yes. I met a few in my time. And I guess I did get into some trouble. What young rebellious man doesn't?</line>
    <line id="190929">And it was that rebellion that saw him cross paths with the law numerous times.</line>
    <line id="190930">Do you know how I got my nickname? I was a young man. Here in Chicago. We'd finished busting a union run. We did a lot of those back then. We were ambushed. A gangland hit. One of the attackers was firing directly at me. Again and again. And I marched right to him. Shot him dead.</line>
    <line id="190931">One of his bullets grazed my ear. The rest of my party was killed. I've been Lucky ever since.</line>
    <line id="190932">Remarkably, Quinn was acquitted of any charges due to a self-defense claim. We're going to take a quick break. Stay tuned.</line>

This is typical bad guy with gun. Maybe he have training, maybe not. Maybe he get lucky shot, maybe not. Actually, probably not. If one of these guys takes you out, you're in wrong line of business.</line>
    <line id="195883">Veteran</line>
    <line id="195884">By PistolPiotr001
Okay, these guys have been around the block a few times. They know how to aim and they won't panic when you shoot back. You should keep an eye on them, but they are no problem for PistolPiotr001.

Sniping can be useful, but when that is all you do, you are a pussy. A real man is not afraid to get up close, no? If you see one of these guys just use his telltale laser to find him and make him eat many pieces of lead.</line>
    <line id="195889">Elite
By PistolPiotr001
Now it is getting serious. Elites have the skills of a veteran but are better equipped. Their pesky body armor makes them bigger threat. I would use big guns on them, just to be safe.</line>
    <line id="195890">Enforcer
By PistolPiotr001
This is more PistolPiotr001's style. Enforcers wear heavy body armor and charge in with guns blazing. PistolPiotr001 respects their bravado. What they lack in brains they make up for in guts.</line>

    <line id="198090">Well, I've found Aiden. Poor boy's a mess. Running in circles, spying, snooping. It's sad, really. He's like a little feral puppy. I'd rather not bother but he could be useful. Aiden's a funny one. Saddled with too many morals, too much guilt. He'd never understand what I'm doing. But he'd understand personal vengeance. And that's the itch I'll scratch. If I play him right, he'll get me everything I need. And he'll be none the wiser.</line>

    <line id="198998">If we find Kenney, you need to be careful. He's a very dangerous man.</line>
    <line id="198999">Dangerous, huh? What's his story?</line>
    <line id="199000">He's a Blume whistleblower ... or a "cyber-terrorist." Depends on who you ask. He delivered his message by blacking out most of New York state.</line>
    <line id="199003">I remember that--2003. Not just New York, that was most of the northeast. Killed a couple of people.</line>
    <line id="199005">He killed eleven people. They called it a software error.</line>

    <line id="199017">You need to connect me. Once I'm in, I'll sniff him out. If you keep me connected long enough, I'll find the source.</line>
    <line id="199018">Don't worry about that. I'll keep you connected.</line>
    <line id="199019">Just be careful. There's been a lot of chatter searching for Kenney. Anyone can intercept our call and get to him first.</line>
    <line id="199020">What happened to undetected access?</line>

    <line id="199108">ctOS...it really is a wonder of human ingenuity. A model system making a model city for model citizens. I wonder what Blume said about potential hacks to the system. Sound debate, I'm sure. "Hackers? Oh relax. Our ctOS is the most advanced blabbidy blah blah bah". Hubris, Aiden. It'll get you every time. But then you know that very well, don't you?</line>
    <line id="199112">Ahh, the silent treatment. You'll leave me an emotional wreck. And who knows what I'll do in such a state. Come on, Aiden. Impress me. What will you do now? Throw me off my game...come on! You can do better.</line>
    <line id="199114">All right. Color me impressed. What was that? A virus of some kind. You've taken quite the shine to all this hacker business.</line>
    <line id="199117">Noodle away, Aiden. You don't really understand what I'm doing.</line>
    <line id="199118">You're trying to destroy the city.</line>
    <line id="199119">Ah, it lives. No, not destroy. Cripple. So every one of them can know what it feels like to have their future taken from them. And I'm saving the best for you, partner.</line>
    <line id="199122">I see what you're doing. Upload your little virus, it sniffs around and finds me. Then you come beat up the cripple. That about right?

    <line id="201018">Results of WKZ's latest opinion poll are in and public opinion of the vigilante is at it's lowest level ever.</line>
    <line id="201019">Police are inundated with calls with tips on the vigilante. Chicago citizens are outraged that the police haven't managed to catch a man who many are calling a terrorist.</line>
    <line id="201020">Where is The Fox? That is the question on everyone's mind as the citizens demand that the violent vigilante be brought to justice.</line>
    <line id="201021">Chicago's vigilante continues his reign of chaos and police seem incapable of stopping him. Citizens are advised not to approach the vigilante if they see him.</line>
    <line id="201022">Public outcry is so extreme that police have opened a new hotline dedicated exclusively to calls about the vigilante. They are asking viewers to use the number if they have any information about this dangerous criminal.</line>
    <line id="201023">A stern warning from the Chicago police chief to the vigilante: "You are not above the law." Fuelled by recent vigilante actions and complaints from angry citizens, the police department has vowed to not rest until the vigilante is arrested.</line>
    <line id="201024">The citizens of Chicago have had enough. Recent polls show that a majority of people want the vigilante to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</line>
    <line id="201025">Social media is buzzing about the vigilante. One poster wrote: "The vigilante must be stopped. He is a menace to the city." That's just one of many posts decrying Chicago's self-appointed crime fighter.</line>
    <line id="201026">The growing anger towards the vigilante has pressured the Chicago PD to issue a statement: "Under no circumstances should citizens intervene or try to subdue the vigilante. Instead, notify police immediately."</line>
    <line id="201027">Chicago PD officers are pledging to capture the vigilante, working longer hours without pay. This initiative is in response to the growing demands from the population to apprehend this dangerous criminal.</line>
    <line id="201028">Violence spreads in the streets as the vigilante continues his destructive crime spree. Could the public outrage at this criminal be the cause of an unexpected spike in Chicago police recruits?</line>
    <line id="201029">Our recent opinion poll has people overwhelmingly against the vigilante. Many cite the wake of destruction he's left behind as he battles gang violence across the city.</line>
    <line id="201030">Chicago citizens are furious that police have yet to arrest the vigilante known as The Fox. According to our recent poll, people consider the vigilante to be as big a threat to safety as street gangs and organized crime.</line>
    <line id="201031">Chicago citizens want police to put an end to the vigilante. Some are even going so far as to equate his actions to domestic terrorism.</line>
    <line id="201032">Chicago residents are sounding off on the vigilante and they're not happy. Social media sites show that a vast majority of posters are against the actions of this dangerous individual.</line>
    <line id="201033">Are you angry over the vigilante? You're not alone. A recent WKZ opinion poll shows that a majority of people disapprove of the vigilante's actions.</line>
    <line id="201035">Well now that we're able to put a name to the vigilante, does that change people's opinions? Not if the recent polls are true. Chicago citizens want Aiden Pearce thrown in jail for life.</line>
    <line id="201036">Vigilante Aiden Pearce has struck again. He's been terrorizing citizens in the name of justice for months now and people have had enough. Some are even referring to Pearce as a terrorist.</line>
    <line id="201039">Chicago citizens aren't concerned about the vigilante as the police would like them to be. A recent WKZ poll reveals that more than 60 percent of citizens support the vigilante.</line>
    <line id="201040">Public enthusiasm for the vigilante is on the rise, with more and more people voicing their support for the vigilante's crusade against crime. Chicago police, however, are still wary.</line>
    <line id="201041">As authorities follow the trail of the vigilante, they are finding little help from witnesses and bystanders. It seems like The Fox is winning the favor of Chicago citizens.</line>
    <line id="201042">In other news, police are baffled by the outpouring of support for the vigilante, who has yet to be caught. Police are insisting the vigilante is highly dangerous.</line>
    <line id="201043">Are you a fan of the vigilante? Well, you're not alone. Pro-vigilante groups and forums are popping up online, and membership seems to be growing at a steady rate.</line>
    <line id="201044">What an outpouring of support for the man they're calling The Fox. The vigilante has been trying to clean up our city and citizens want him to keep doing what he's doing.</line>
    <line id="201045">He's earned the nickname, The Fox, for outsmarting criminals, and Chicago loves him for it. Our station is flooded with praise for the vigilante's actions. Keep your comments rolling in.</line>
    <line id="201046">After a number of criminal arrests by the police, people believe the real credit belongs to The Fox. Our station is flooded with praise for the vigilante. So if you're watching... Chicago says, "keep up the good work."</line>
    <line id="201047">Who is the vigilante, and why can't we get enough of him? After the break, we'll sit down with a criminologist and a psychiatrist and figure out what makes this crime fighter so appealing.</line>
    <line id="201048">Chicago's gang-busting vigilante has struck again. He's been getting criminals off the streets and winning the approval of Chicagoans citywide.</line>
    <line id="201049">Social media is buzzing about Chicago's vigilante. One viewer wrote the following: "Leave the vigilante alone! He's making more of a difference in this city than the entire Chicago police department!"</line>
    <line id="201050">Approval ratings are high for the vigilante known as The Fox. In this reporter's opinion, Mayor Rushmore should be jealous of these numbers.</line>

    <line id="201689">In other news, vigilante Aiden Pearce is still at large. No word yet from police. Though an anonymous tip reports that he may have left the city. We'll bring more information to you as it comes.</line>
    <line id="201691">City officials are picking up the pieces from the shocking chaos brought on by a massive ctOS malfunction. The city experienced major power outages, bridge disruptions, and thousands of dollars in damages. 
While ctOS is back online, many are raising questions about the safety features needed to run a complex system in a major city.</line>
    <line id="201692">A recent city poll shows a surprising majority of locals still supports a ctOS network. 56% of respondents strongly supported ctOS despite the city-wide malfunctions. Well, I guess that's the Chicago way.</line>
    <line id="201693">Investigators of the ctOS service disruption have confirmed they have uncovered evidence that suggests the ctOS network may have been hacked. While initial reports suggested a flaw to the system, new evidence indicates tampering with the network. Anonymous sources suggest these hacks may have come from a single smart phone while city officials have called such speculation 'ridiculous'.</line>
    <line id="201694">With Chicago still reeling from the shocking revelations of Rose Washington's murder, and Mayor Rushmore's subsequent death, there has been little appetite for politics or elections. One name that's been floated about is Blume's VP of Communications, Charlotte Gardner. Her supporters insist Ms. Gardner will restore integrity and trust to a city that sorely needs it.</line>
    <line id="201695">Police are puzzled by the scene that greeted them at the abandoned lighthouse in Lake Michigan. The body of a white male was found on the gallery deck apparently killed by a short in the lamp light. Curiously, his pockets were stuffed with what police describe as mad scribblings. The term bellwether was written over and over with a sequence of numbers covering the flip side. Mad scribblings indeed.</line>
    <line id="201696">[#PLAYERB] wrecked [#PLAYERA]'s vehicle</line>
    <line id="201699">Blume Director of Public Relations, Charlotte Gardner has issued a statement regarding the recent ctOS troubles.
We knew all along that our ctOS network would be a target for hackers of all strengths and skills. It's been an excellent proving ground to demonstrate how robust our system really is. We are so pleased with the results. 
Our firewall security withheld the worst of the attacks and in some cases trip switches closed the systems off before any access could be gained. 
Your personal information remains secure.

Renowned child psychologist, Yolanda Mendez is with us. Doctor Mendez, your story is extraordinary. You actually know Aiden Pearce, the man we know as the vigilante. Tell us how that came about? 
I met Mr. Pearce through the family, his sister.
This was a surprise to us. We couldn't find any information about him at all. It's great that you've come forward. You were treating her son for trauma?
Yes. Well, naturally, I can't discuss any of that. Not even their names.
No, no, no, no. We won't ask you to. But that's how you met Aiden Pearce. What's he like?
It's impossible to say for certain what he's really like. He masks his personality. And he's very good at it.
Is he?
It isn't like someone playing poker. This is a very smart man who is looking to gain the upper hand in every situation.
And you're writing a book.
Yes I am. It's a book about the whole experience. A study on Mr. Pearce. I really wanted to explore this complex man's mind.
I'm sure it'll be a fascinating read. Doctor Mendez, thank you.</line>

    <line id="204486">In fact, Ms. Gardner, these peacekeepers you refer to are military mercenaries. Many with criminal records, isn't that true?</line>
    <line id="204487">Indeed they've served time in the military but we should hardly reject our brave soldiers for proudly serving their country, should we? Our ctOS Network is well protected. And that gives Chicago citizens the comfort they deserve.</line>
    <line id="204489">That was Blume Spokeswoman Charlotte Gardner discussing ctOS security.</line>
    <line id="204493">Give me time to track your caller. I'll be in touch.</line>
    <line id="204499">Let's do that. Blume's building a new ctOS Center in the Loop. It's perfect.</line>
    <line id="204500">DedSec tried to attack that center last month. We failed--and they just added more armed guards, so it won't be easy. Be careful.</line>
    <line id="204501">You sound like my sister. Relax, I'll make sure I'm armed and dangerous.</line>
    <line id="204516">Did you catch the press conference last night? Mayor Rushmore apologizing ... again, this time for "lewd conduct" with one of his staff. Basically means he got a BJ, right? Thing is, I went to the official site and found the team picture, trying to figure out which one it was and... damn. Let's just say I hope she was under the desk... </line>
    <line id="204519">Hey. I need you to cover something for me.</line>
    <line id="204520">I lined up a lucrative deal with a very demanding client and he needs a driver.</line>

    <line id="204522">Here's the thing--I come in this morning and find Maurice trying to dig his way out of his guest room, so I need to move him. Now I could pass this problem onto you since really Maurice is your problem. But that's not my style. I always finish what I start. And all I'm asking of you...</line>
    <line id="204523">All right, fine. I'll handle it.</line>
    <line id="204525">Then he's in luck.</line>
    <line id="204526">What is it?</line>
    <line id="204542">Hey, how'd it go? You finish that job yet?</line>
    <line id="204543">You thought I'd be okay working for the fucking Club?</line>
    <line id="204544">A paycheck is a paycheck. You've got to start separating the morals from the moola.  Relax. Listen ... I can hook you up with my guy. He'll find you better driving gigs if you want.</line>
    <line id="204545">Yeah sure, I dunno if I'll take them...but give him my name.</line>
    <line id="204546">Who says no to extra cash, right? Oh and since you asked, Maurice is doing just fine in his new home.</line>
    <line id="204547">Yeah. Yeah--OK. Shit, my hands won't stop shaking. You ever seen a guy shot in the guts before?</line>
    <line id="204548">Too many.</line>
    <line id="204562">You need to calm down. They've got the island locked up. We'll stick to the back alleys, garages--keep out of sight. If you see me kill the engine and cut the lights, you keep quiet. We'll just be an old parked car. You understand?</line>
    <line id="204575">ctOS pays almost twice what I made in Kandahar. You believe that? And trust me, I'll take DedSec any day over a Taliban sniper. Just say boo to any of those hacker goons and they're crawling back to their keyboards.</line>
    <line id="204637">I've hired Badboy before and he's always protected his identity. That's how DedSec works. But now he wants to meet. That's unusual. I'll try to shake him off his game. Let's see what he's up to...</line>

    <line id="204646">Maybe she's right. Lena's dead, I can't change that. How do I just walk away?</line>
    <line id="204650">I've got something for you. We need to meet.</line>

    <line id="207704">Angelo Tucci. This guy's leading this “prison transfer” for my witness. Somebody’s paying Tucci for the vigilante’s identity. Somebody wants my name. Good luck with that.</line>

    <line id="207738">Well, I didn't kill you.</line>
    <line id="207739">We used to get along. I taught you so much. Look at you, a big time hacker now. Is that you in the news? The vigilante.</line>
    <line id="207740">You mentioned a second hacker at the Merlaut job. But we already knew there was another hacker. You found something new.</line>
    <line id="207741">Ahh. Intriguing, isn't it? Come, let's meet and I'll explain.</line>
    <line id="207742">Tell me. Then I'll consider meeting.</line>
    <line id="207743">Oh no. My information, my rules. Besides, we need to make up for last time. I'm very excited, Aiden. Come soon.</line>
    <line id="207750">That a problem?</line>
    <line id="207751">Nope. I'll scare them good. He'll never bother you again.</line>
    <line id="207754">What's up with this fixer contract? What are they looking for?</line>
    <line id="207755">You. Somebody wants "the Vigilante" big-time. And they're about to fake a prisoner transfer to bust out the one witness who can ID you. I've never seen them gather up this kind of manpower, though.</line>
    <line id="207757">Ah. The F word. You're too sentimental, Pearce. That's a weakness. Someone's gonna play that against you one day. I'll cover you where I can, but I can't see everybody. Let's do this.</line>

    <line id="208390">I need that right now. How do I do it?</line>
    <line id="208391">It's locked. Hold on, I'm sending something. It's a zero day exploit. The trains won't recognize the hack. But it only works once.</line>
    <line id="208392">Send it now!</line>
    <line id="208396">It's sent. What happened, Aiden?</line>
    <line id="208397">I don't have time. Meet me at the Owl Motel later, okay?</line>
    <line id="208400">Nothing.</line>
    <line id="208402">The computer. I can hack the cameras through the computer.</line>
    <line id="208403">Damien knows me too well...knows exactly how I’ll react. He must have been planning this for a while. That man always goes too far. He'll hurt Nicky if he doesn't get what he wants. For now, I’ll play his damn game. I'll follow his IP address. But I'm going to find a way around him.</line>
    <line id="208406">Did you find Tobias?</line>
    <line id="208407">I did.</line>
    <line id="208408">And?</line>
    <line id="208409">We played poker. Had a nice talk.</line>
    <line id="208410">What did he say?</line>
    <line id="208411">Clara. It's real.</line>
    <line id="208412">I told you! Don't go in without me! I'm on my way!</line>
    <line id="208413">Don't worry. I still have to restore the power. And then we have to find an entrance. I'll see you soon.</line>
    <line id="208415">There's got to be a way through this. And Damien's all ego ... he needs this victory. I’ll give it to him—I’ll find that second hacker and he’ll let Nicky go. Do I believe that? Doesn’t matter, right now I’ve got no other options.</line>
    <line id="208417">All right, she's safe. For now. She's somewhere cold. Maybe outdoors. I'll keep her talking and maybe I can find where she is.</line>
    <line id="208420">I just heard the generator kick on.</line>
    <line id="208421">It's gonna need more juice than this. Can you look for an entrance? How would Blume hide a place like this?</line>
    <line id="208422">I hope there's a secret elevator. You pull a switch and the floor drops into a hidden base deep underground.</line>
    <line id="208423">Under water? We are on an island.</line>
    <line id="208424">Wishful thinking. Up then. One of the buildings. I'll keep looking.</line>
    <line id="208425">Almost there. Once we're in, can you get us online?</line>
    <line id="208426">In my circle, this is the find of the century. If I fuck it up, you can take away my hacker card.</line>
    <line id="208427">Do you actually have a hacker card?</line>
    <line id="208428">Get us inside, maybe I'll show it to you someday.</line>
    <line id="208429">I'm working on it.</line>
    <line id="208432">I found it! I just heard the system come back online.</line>
    <line id="208433">Wait for me.</line>
    <line id="208436">Why? It's perfectly safe - nobody's been inside for years.</line>
    <line id="208437">Because I want to see your face when the door opens.</line>
    <line id="208439">I've just lost everything. My hard drives, my network access. Alright, I need to get back online. Where's Clara? Be careful, Aiden. Don’t pull her into this.</line>
    <line id="208443">He's got an underground shop hidden in there. DedSec goes there for some of the more rare hardware. You can forget him. He's paranoid and won't talk.</line>
    <line id="208462">I'll let you do the talking.</line>
    <line id="208463">You really want this place to be real, don't you?</line>
    <line id="208464">It is real.</line>
    <line id="208465">So you're buying into the legend.</line>
    <line id="208466">Papa used to take me camping in Mont-Tremblant. He'd always say we were looking for treasure--I didn't understand then that he was stealing from the cabins. Gold watches, tools. The look on his face when it was something special ... like one time when I found an old rusted coin with a regal emperor. He said it was an ancient Roman coin ... priceless. But he let me keep it, said it was my door to a magic world--the whole Roman empire. I guess I am my father's daughter. Stars in my eyes.</line>
    <line id="208467">Well I hope this bunker's real too.</line>
    <line id="208468">It's real.</line>
    <line id="208469">Charming.</line>
    <line id="208470">He lives right near here. There's a homeless camp.</line>
    <line id="208471">He's homeless?</line>
    <line id="208472">I can be persuasive.</line>
    <line id="208473">Fuck that. You're not going without me.</line>
    <line id="208475">You want to go alone, don't you? Alright.  I'll meet you at the island.</line>
    <line id="208476">You sure?</line>
    <line id="208477">What does it look like?</line>
    <line id="208478">The Viceroys have disabled the ctOS around Rossi-Fremont. They've got it completely rerouted. And it's not just the ctOS that's offline. This whole area ... these people, it feels like the aftermath of a war zone.</line>
    <line id="208479">That explains why Blume hasn't fixed it.</line>
    <line id="208480">Blume has the money to deal with this. Doesn't add up.</line>
    <line id="208483">There they are. They're gonna hunt him down fast. I need to stop them.</line>
    <line id="208486">Almost there. I'm thinking Chicago is seriously underestimating the Viceroys. These guys know what they're doing.</line>
    <line id="208489">So things just got more complicated...</line>
    <line id="208490">Yeah ... now I'm worried about what we'll find inside.</line>
    <line id="208496">Rossi-Fremont. They had such big hopes for this place. All that did was bring the gangs together under one roof. Loyalty to your neighborhood just became loyalty to your housing block.</line>
    <line id="208499">Just so you know, you're off my GRID and in the dark.</line>
    <line id="208500">What about everybody else?</line>
    <line id="208501">They got in line or they got out. I'm going to take a look around--try to figure out what they've been up to.</line>
    <line id="208506">Thank you ... for all of this. You really came through.</line>
    <line id="208507">Hey ... I can't resist a good adventure. So I guess we're done?</line>
    <line id="208508">No, I'm just getting started. I need to get in there, find some answers and get my sister back.</line>
    <line id="208509">And once you get your answers, what then?</line>
    <line id="208510">Then I find out who did this and I make sure they answer for it. Every single person involved in Lena's death. [beat] You still there?</line>
    <line id="208511">That should do it.</line>
    <line id="208512">Yeah, we are connected. You'll be able to peek into Rossi-Fremont now.</line>
    <line id="208515">There. The IP address is coming from that room.</line>
    <line id="208516">There's a card reader on it. Shit.</line>
    <line id="208517">The key's hidden in his dogtag.</line>
    <line id="208526">That fat kid, Bedbug -- he's going to go in for me.</line>
    <line id="208527">Just like that? And why should he help us?</line>
    <line id="208528">I'm betting he's one mistake away from a bullet to the head, so when he makes that mistake--I'll be recording. Nothing like blackmail to change someone's tune.</line>
    <line id="208533">I could easily end up a mess like Tobias. I’m being chased by the same people. Hell, I guess I’m homeless now, too. But he was high on medication or something. That guy has to be careful. He's got fixers after him. If they find him, who knows what they'll do.</line>
    <line id="208535">The bunker. Clara's putting a lot of faith in this legend. And Tobias was pretty spooked by it. I'm not interested in the myth, but if it helps me get Nicky, then I'll use it.</line>
    <line id="208537">Damien's IP points somewhere in there. These guys are running the place like a fortress. I'll never break in alone. Okay, I'll tap into their network -- then we can get a look inside.</line>
    <line id="208539">All right, back to the bunker. I'll tap in and see what Rossi-Fremont's hiding.</line>
    <line id="208540">I read the news today. Something about a high speed chase near Parker Square. Had all the hallmarks of Aiden Pearce.</line>
    <line id="208541">Yeah. There's something inside Rossi-Fremont. Some kind of small server hidden behind a locked door and an army of gangbangers.</line>
    <line id="208542">Now you understand why I need your help. Have you found a way in?</line>
    <line id="208545">[Silence 2] Aiden.</line>
    <line id="208546">Hey -- we're getting close. You'll be home soon.</line>
    <line id="208552">Fun's over, kids. I hope your plan's a good one. Nicky does too.</line>
    <line id="208555">Damn. You see Bug running past with his tail between his legs? Pussy.</line>
    <line id="208556">Uh uh. I know Iraq's pissed about somethin'. And when Iraq's in a mood, you know Bedbug ain't far from the mess.</line>
    <line id="208557">Man, I don't care if they are cousins, Iraq needs to out that motherfucker. I'll help him do it, if you know what I'm saying.</line>
    <line id="208560">This is getting complicated. If I can keep Damien focused on that hard drive, I can find Nicky. He'll slip up, I know Damien. I have to be patient and ready.</line>
    <line id="208573">Naw. Soldiers, fam. Remember when Fly and his crew disappeared? They stepped out of line. Iraq put them down himself. I know, because I helped him bury the bodies.</line>
    <line id="208578">True, true. But that's why I want to keep you where you are.  Listen though, for real - you want to move up ... I ain't supposed to say nothing, but Iraq's been moving weight up into Parker Square. I'll talk to him. He might be able to cut you in.</line>
    <line id="208650">Rabbit. What's up?</line>
    <line id="208651">Got something you're gonna want to hear, Bug. Trust me.</line>
    <line id="208652">So tell me.</line>
    <line id="208653">Not here, fam. Let's meet. You got that dough on you?</line>
    <line id="208654">Always. Why?</line>
    <line id="208655">No, this is gonna cost you. But it's worth it, trust me.</line>
    <line id="208656">We'll see about that.</line>
    <line id="208665">I'm taking a gamble with Bedbug but I have a hunch he's my perfect target. Doesn't have much, he has a lot to lose. Easily intimidated. And ambitious, but lazy. Alright, start with his home, tap his cell phone. Just record everything he says.</line>
    <line id="208666">There. That's the blackmail I'm after. Iraq hears this little gem and Bedbug will be buried in a landfill.</line>
    <line id="208667">Look it's simple. They're gonna call you down to the Bricks and then they're going to kill you.</line>
    <line id="208668">That's bullshit, man!</line>
    <line id="208669">Whoa, hey hey! What are you doing man?</line>
    <line id="208674">Aight. Talk.</line>
    <line id="208675">Look, I want 500 for what I know.</line>
    <line id="208676">What the fuck do you know that's worth that much cash?</line>
    <line id="208678">Because you ain't got much time left unless you pay up now, fam.</line>
    <line id="208679">You're going to threaten me? You don't fuck with me, man. You don't think Iraq won't hear about this?  What's wrong with you?</line>
    <line id="208680">[Silence 3]Aw dude ... Iraq, serious? Iraq is your fucking problem.</line>
    <line id="208681">A'ight, a'ight, a'ight. Tell me what you know[Silence 2]Here. This better be good.</line>
    <line id="208686">Look, it's true, Bug! I wouldn't fucking lie to you, Joe! Man, I've been with you since the fucking beginning, you remember that shit?  Look, I needed the money for a ticket out, look fam, that's all.</line>
    <line id="208692">You're gonna lie to me? Steal from me? Ah nah, you're done.</line>
    <line id="208693">Who is this?</line>
    <line id="208694">The guy who just saved your ass. I can do a lot more if you cooperate. What are "The Bricks?"</line>
    <line id="208695">You get me out of here, and I'll tell you.</line>
    <line id="208696">Alright, pay attention.</line>
    <line id="208699">Talk.</line>
    <line id="208700">Look, Iraq is sending Bedbug to The Bricks to take him out, Joe. Look it's a fucking death sentence. Look he'll have some of his toughest dudes on it, I'm telling you.</line>
    <line id="208701">Iraq's put a kill order on Bedbug?</line>
    <line id="208708">Yo. What's up, fam?</line>
    <line id="208709">Hey cuz. Listen, I got some business I need you to handle down at the Bricks. It has to be you because I know can trust you. Rabbit will take you over.</line>
    <line id="208712">Yeah, man. If he can't prove himself ... He's fucking dead. But you saw Bug man--come on man ... he's got no fucking chance. I was just trying to warn his stupid ass.</line>
    <line id="208713">Now you do what you said-- you take that 500 and get out of town. Talk to nobody.</line>
    <line id="208714">Look, that's nothing. I got you.</line>
    <line id="208716">Shit, Iraq's put a kill command on Bedbug. I need to show up in his place and deal with these guys.</line>
    <line id="208717">Man, don't say that shit out loud, son. You know your fam is paranoid about that shit getting back to him.</line>
    <line id="208718">I'll say whatever I want.</line>
    <line id="208719">Damn, B. Not so loud!</line>
    <line id="208720">What, are you paranoid too?</line>
    <line id="208721">Only when I'm around your ass, fam. </line>
    <line id="208722">Where is this place?</line>
    <line id="208723">Sienna Brick Factory. "The Bricks."</line>
    <line id="208724">Th--the Bricks? You sure? Huh maybe somebody else could--</line>
    <line id="208725">Don't be soft, man. Ain't got no time for soft.</line>
    <line id="208726">Yeah, yeah ... ok.</line>
    <line id="208728">This is bad. If Bedbug's killed, I lose my way into Rossi-Fremont.</line>
    <line id="208729">These guys are running a regular drop. Huh… alright, a few well-placed explosives and I can start this off with a bang.</line>
    <line id="208738">I'm setting up an ambush. I need you to bring me some explosives. Can you do that?</line>
    <line id="208741">Sienna Brick Factory. Iraq's men were gonna kill Bedbug right here. I don’t need the complications. Alright, just lay out an ambush, take these guys out. Word’ll get back to Iraq, Bedbug's rep goes up. And then he's mine.</line>
    <line id="208742">It's abandoned. They must keep security cameras running.</line>
    <line id="208744">Tire tracks. Someone's regular parking spot.</line>
    <line id="208745">More tire tracks. The cars come in from both ends.</line>
    <line id="208747">The deals go down right here.</line>
    <line id="208749">Good cover. I can see everything from here.</line>
    <line id="208750">He's getting away. He'll report to Iraq...and Bedbug is as good as dead.</line>
    <line id="208751">Good timing. Your sweetheart Maurice was just moaning at me. Says you got it all wrong. He's a patsy, was set up. Whine whine, waah waah. Mind if I drill a couple rounds in his kneecaps?</line>
    <line id="208752">Yeah, I mind.</line>
    <line id="208753">You're so predictable. See if I do you a favor again.</line>
    <line id="208754">Actually --</line>
    <line id="208755">-- you need a favor.</line>
    <line id="208756">I can do anything. Do I wanna do it -- is the question. Oh wait ... You know what, this is great -- yeah. Let me round up the boys and I'll meet you there.</line>
    <line id="208758">How did it go? Did you find a way into Iraq's building?</line>
    <line id="208759">Yeah Bedbug's on board and waiting for my call. Let's talk about the access card Iraq was wearing. That's our only way into his room.</line>
    <line id="208760">It's an RFID tag. We can clone it but you need to get very close.</line>
    <line id="208761">Bedbug says Iraq's attending an auction. That's my chance.</line>
    <line id="208762">The auction, yes. Remember that briefcase Iraq had?</line>
    <line id="208763">Hard to forget. He crushed that guy's skull with it...</line>
    <line id="208764">Right. He said it had the guest list inside. You can thank me now because I've been tracking that case. Now let me check...</line>
    <line id="208765">That was quick thinking. If we get that briefcase, can you find me a name on the guest list? A name I can borrow?</line>
    <line id="208766">Exactly my thoughts. I'm sending the briefcase location now.</line>
    <line id="208768">Tell me how to get close to Iraq.</line>
    <line id="208769">You ain't getting close to Iraq, man. Forget it. He never comes out.</line>
    <line id="208770">You want to rethink your answer?</line>
    <line id="208771">Wait, wait ... the auction. He'll be at Quinn's auction.</line>
    <line id="208772">So get me an invite.</line>
    <line id="208773">Who do you think I am?</line>
    <line id="208774">Alright, alright. I'll be in touch. Be ready.</line>
    <line id="208776">Shit, man. I appreciate what you did for me at the Bricks, man. Iraq couldn't believe it.</line>
    <line id="208777">But he did believe it, right?</line>
    <line id="208778">Yeah, yeah  he did. He's all proud and shit. I can't risk pissing him off again, man. You understand?</line>
    <line id="208779">There's a bar near Rossi-Fremont. I'm leaving something in the trash. It's a wire. Go get it.</line>
    <line id="208780">Listen - you spooked him at the auction. Now nobody gets into the upper floors without his permission. Including me.</line>
    <line id="208783">We'll be discreet.</line>
    <line id="208784">Come on, man. Aww fuck!</line>
    <line id="208785">I'm so scared, man.</line>
    <line id="208786">Just listen to what I say and move when I tell you. I'm going to watch out for you.</line>
    <line id="208787">Ok, ok.</line>
    <line id="208789">Oh fuck. Oh fuck.</line>
    <line id="208790">Relax. How old are you?</line>
    <line id="208791">19. I'm 19, man.</line>
    <line id="208792">Jesus, you're still a kid.</line>
    <line id="208793">Gramma says I was always big for my age.</line>
    <line id="208795">Why are you hanging around these assholes?</line>
    <line id="208796">They're my family. Well, I thought they were. You got family?</line>
    <line id="208797">Yeah.</line>
    <line id="208798">Kids?</line>
    <line id="208799"> No. You?</line>
    <line id="208800">Probably. . Shit. Don't make me laugh.</line>
    <line id="208801">Yeah, that could be bad.</line>
    <line id="208803">So why are you doing this, man? This- this ain't your world.</line>
    <line id="208804">It's complicated.</line>
    <line id="208805">We got plenty of time. </line>
    <line id="208806">Iraq was involved in something that hurt my family. I want answers.</line>
    <line id="208807">That ain't so complicated.</line>
    <line id="208808">Tell me you got something.</line>
    <line id="208809">It was only a partial download but I definitely got something. It looks like his computer is full of blackmail on ... everybody. Just listen to these folder names. "Police Chief Sex Tape," "Blume CEO Bribe," "ctOS Breaches."</line>
    <line id="208810">Iraq's sitting on the most dangerous weapon in the city. No wonder the cops stay away. He's probably had a chat with the Police Chief. Can you see what's inside the folders?</line>
    <line id="208811">Not yet. I'm trying.</line>
    <line id="208812">Is there a folder for the Merlaut?</line>
    <line id="208813">...Merlaut. Yes, there is.</line>
    <line id="208814">Good. I'll be there soon.</line>
    <line id="208815">Hey, hey. This thing still work?</line>
    <line id="208816">Bedbug? You're alive. Hey you need to get out of there.</line>
    <line id="208819">I AM out. I just thought maybe I could help you get your answers. You know huh... about your family. That video we saw on the screen. Iraq asked me about it, huh. Asked me what I knew about huh "Rose Washington."</line>
    <line id="208822">Rose Washington... ?</line>
    <line id="208823">Yeah, yeah. You and me ... are we done?</line>
    <line id="208824">We're done. You did good, Bedbug.</line>
    <line id="208825">You made a lot of noise at Rossi-Fremont. Please give me good news.</line>
    <line id="208826">Iraq's got dirt on a lot of people--his computer's full of it. Everybody from politicians to ctOS execs. The Merlaut is in there, too.</line>
    <line id="208827">I knew it. I told you it was there!</line>
    <line id="208828">It's encrypted. I don't have access to it, but that video we found at the Merlaut? The woman's name is Rose Washington.</line>
    <line id="208829">But we're just starting. That video is important to someone. Important enough to attack me -- to attack your niece.</line>
    <line id="208830">Do you see the case?</line>
    <line id="208831">I do. It's moving. Wait--I can't believe it...</line>
    <line id="208832">What?</line>
    <line id="208833">Quinn's guys are pulling some old-school gangster shit. A briefcase swap? Really?</line>
    <line id="208834">Do those actually work?</line>
    <line id="208835">I've never seen one of these.  Why are they doing this? Could they fool ctOS?</line>
    <line id="208836">Anybody watching through a monitor would see every swap...</line>
    <line id="208837">They're trying to confuse the detection software. Interesting.</line>
    <line id="208839">They've got the case on a boat, heading up river. I got a bike here. I’m gonna follow.</line>
    <line id="208840">Maybe I can see where they're going. Give me a sec.</line>
    <line id="208841">What do we have nearby? My guess: this'll be a short trip. There's another drop for another pick-up.</line>
    <line id="208843">Ok ... no .... no .... wait, there's an old marina. Bought by Lucky Quinn in 1967.</line>
    <line id="208844">That's gotta be it.</line>
    <line id="208846">The Boss wanted me to explain just how important this is. You're not just carrying a case of names and invites--you're carrying the future of our business--background checks, indiscretions, tendencies--everything Quinn needs to keep his guests loyal, got it? Now pretend this thing is full of solid fucking gold bricks.</line>
    <line id="208848">Ok. Ok--this one -- can you pull off a Mr. Pang?</line>
    <line id="208849">I don't think so. Any Europeans?</line>
    <line id="208850">I'm sending the guest list from the case. Whatever this auction is, the Club's not taking chances. Security will be tight.</line>
    <line id="208851">Nicholas Crispin. 32 years old. Ex-pat American. Hasn't been back in 12 years.</line>
    <line id="208852">Will anyone miss him?</line>
    <line id="208853">Oh...no I guess not.</line>
    <line id="208855">Hi, this is Aiden. Jacks' uncle. I wanted to make sure things are going OK there.</line>
    <line id="208856">First, I want to know if things are OK with Nicky. We haven't heard from her.</line>
    <line id="208857">She's still working things out. She just needs a little more time.</line>
    <line id="208858">Well Jackson misses her terribly. She should at least give him a call. I can tell he's restless. He's not happy here.</line>
    <line id="208859">I understand--and I'll let her know. You have any problems with Jacks, anything at all. If he wanders off or...anything--you call me right away.</line>
    <line id="208860">I will. You take care of that sister of yours.</line>
    <line id="208861">Yeah ... I am.</line>
    <line id="208862">Enforcer Combat Take Down</line>
    <line id="208863">Take down Enforcers in combat.</line>
    <line id="208864">It looks like Crispin was on his way to pick up something called "The Poppy Special." It's at a club called "Infinite 92."</line>
    <line id="208865">Infinite ... 92. No official listings. I see mention of it in some threads here. Oh-- looks like it's a "gentleman's" fetish club. Underground… of course.</line>
    <line id="208866">So the Poppy Special is a woman...</line>
    <line id="208867">That fits the profile Quinn had on Crispin. I doubt Poppy would've survived the meeting. What kind of auction is this?</line>
    <line id="208868">I think we both know the answer to that. I'm going to the club now. Crispin's invite is there.</line>
    <line id="208870">Clara, to pass as Crispin, I'm going to need to do some shopping. Can you dig up some photos and tell me what to look for?</line>
    <line id="208871">Uh oh. Now we're shopping together?</line>
    <line id="208872">Ha. Ha.</line>
    <line id="208873">Oh, gross! He's not even wearing clothes in most of these pictures.</line>
    <line id="208874">Great.</line>
    <line id="208875">When he does wear clothes, he likes bad hats. He looks like he shops at Creeps Unlimited.</line>
    <line id="208876">Ok. Bad hat. Creepy. Thanks, Clara. You've been a tremendous help.</line>
    <line id="208877">Fashion's not my thing. Now if you want tips on tattoos...</line>

    <line id="208879">Eliminate Iraq's personal guards.</line>
    <line id="208880">Pssst, you think that's him?</line>
    <line id="208881">Yeah, that's gotta be Crispin. Twisted motherfucker.</line>
    <line id="208882">I heard something about cannibalism.</line>
    <line id="208883">Hard to get a date with that reputation.</line>
    <line id="208884">I need a favor. I gotta get Poppy out of this place. Call Infinite 92. Pretend you're Crispin's assistant. Tell them I insist that Poppy be delivered to me at the auction.</line>
    <line id="208888">Mr. Pearce. Jacks has wandered off. I'm very worried. I was going to call the police, but I wanted to call you first.</line>
    <line id="208889">No, that's good. He does this sometimes. He's stressed. He likes to ride the trains. Don't worry - I know how to find him.</line>
    <line id="208890">Please call me once you know anything. We really should involve the police if you can't find him.</line>
    <line id="208891">It's going to be fine. Really.</line>
    <line id="208893">Yo, I just got word from the boss. Some of Quinn's guys got popped. Something ain't right. He wants us to double-check all IDs on everybody who comes in. Triple-check if you have to.</line>
    <line id="208894">New orders. Iraq wants Mr. Crispin found. Do not let him leave the auction. You see him, you grab him.</line>
    <line id="208955">I overheard them talking about Crispin. They know something is wrong--you need to get out of here now--through the basement.</line>
    <line id="208956">Come with me.</line>
    <line id="208957">No, I won't leave my friends.</line>
    <line id="208958">Ok ... I'll send help.</line>
    <line id="208961">There's a big shoot-out going on. At the Barrows in Brandon Docks.</line>
    <line id="208968">I asked for my merchandise to be delivered here. Where can I find Poppy?</line>
    <line id="208969">Mr. Quinn got your request. Don't worry. She's here.</line>
    <line id="208971">I have to tell you Mr. Quinn's rules, though. All payments must be made in cash or through a secured account. If you want to sample any of the girls before they're open to bidding, you gotta pay a small fee. Premium girls are off limits--don't want to lower the value, if you get me.</line>
    <line id="208972">Yeah. I get you.</line>
    <line id="208973">What kind of auction?</line>
    <line id="208974">Private. Like, not your normal kind of auction--invite only.</line>
    <line id="208995">[Silence 1.3]I can't keep running. [Silence 0.8]I can't do it. [Silence 1]That fucking Aiden Pearce. [Silence 1.3]I killed his niece. He won't stop chasing me. [Silence 1.3]Who is this guy? [Silence 1.4]What am I gonna do? He keeps coming!</line>

    <line id="209015">Earlier today, I spoke with Charlotte Gardner, a spokeswoman for Blume, one of America's leading tech giants. I asked her pointedly about Blume's biggest success story: ctOS -- Chicago's Central Operating System.</line>
    <line id="209016">Quite simply, really. ctOS is Blume's city-level operating system, state of the art software, that monitors and controls Chicago's infrastructure. We're talking  about surveillance systems for crime prevention, more efficient bridges, traffic lights, trains. We've even upgraded some of the less flashy things like the crumbling water lines and the overall power grids. Every major part of the city is under the careful watch of ctOS with the primary goal of making life better for everyone.  Except the criminals, of course.</line>
    <line id="209017">And what do you say to the person who thinks this is the first step towards robots enslaving humanity.</line>
    <line id="209018"> I'd remind them that Blume is currently one of the top employers of people in Chicago right now. If I'm wrong, well I guess I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords. (laughs again)</line>
    <line id="209021">Alleged boss of the Chicago South Club, Lucky Quinn, is once again turning heads with large donations to various charity events including Chicago Mayor's own little league baseball team. While some of Quinn's more vocal detractors have insisted charities reject the "blood money," Mayor Rushmore himself has stepped forward in defense of his "old friend," stating Lucky Quinn has never been convicted of any crime. No comment yet from Mr. Quinn's office.</line>
    <line id="209023">Let's return now to a recent interview I conducted with Blume spokeswoman, Charlotte Gardner.</line>
    <line id="209024">Let's be clear. The center was never "dangerous." Yes, it was breached by DedSec hackers and systems were compromised. However, Blume technicians responded immediately and quarantined the building's network. There is no data going in or out of that center. And we continue to work closely with Authorities to identify these reckless hackers.</line>
    <line id="209025">But shutting down for over a year. That might suggest to some that DedSec succeeded in their attack.</line>
    <line id="209026">Their attack helped to keep us on our toes. That's all. Public security is first and foremost on our minds. Until we are 100% sure the system is secure and ready to reconnect to the main network, we're going to keep it dark.</line>
    <line id="209027">And if DedSec tried a similar attack on another ctOS center?</line>
    <line id="209028">I like to think of DedSec like the chicken pox. Sucks the first time you get an outbreak, but then you're immune.</line>
    <line id="209029">That was Charlotte Gardner, spokeswoman for Blume, discussing recent hacker attacks on ctOS. We'll return shortly...</line>
    <line id="209063">Charlotte, let's assume you're introducing the ctOS to somebody who's never heard of it before. How would you sum it up?</line>
    <line id="209065">Charlotte, for over a year now, one of Pawnee's ctOS stations has remained closed. Can you explain what happened to force the closure? Is it still dangerous?</line>
    <line id="209068">Chicago PD today released figures showing a spike in the number of 911 calls on the vigilante. For the last several months, civilians have reported more sightings of the vigilante, an unidentified man who's tackling Chicago's crime head-on. Chicago PD remains determined to capture this would-be crime fighter. Though civilians are split. While some champion him as a hero, others are alarmed by his free use of violence. Whatever opinion you share, be sure to protect yourself out there. If you spot the vigilante, police are urging citizens to call 911 at once. He is armed and dangerous.</line>
    <line id="209074">That's Charlotte Gardner introducing Blume's innovative ctOS. We'll return shortly...</line>

    <line id="209154">I'd pop him and be done, but hey: you pay me, right? I'll keep him alive as long as you want. I do work for a pay check.</line>
    <line id="209155">Okay I'm in lobby of the Merlaut.</line>
    <line id="209156">All right, Aiden. Let's do it.</line>

    <line id="209166">Yeah--he turned against Blume. Exposed their abuse.</line>

    <line id="209168">You're going to threaten him?</line>
    <line id="209169">No. A whistleblower wants justice. He may be looking for a cause and I can definitely give him one.</line>

    <line id="209177">I've hacked in.</line>
    <line id="209178">What, you mean -- you're in the ctOS? Already?</line>
    <line id="209179">I'm looking at the network as we speak. You've got your access. And I've got mine. Profiler system's online, everybody's nasty little secrets at the click of a button. This thing's highlighting all kinds of stuff in the district. I could take advantage of some of this.</line>
    <line id="209180">Keep an eye out for online traffic. Could be fixers in the network.</line>
    <line id="209183">If I can see them, they can see me. All right, I gotta move. I made a lotta noise here.</line>
    <line id="209184">Well don't let me put you out.</line>
    <line id="209185">I said I'll handle it. What's the job exactly?</line>
    <line id="209186">It's a delivery job. Gotta move some guy. I mean, how hard is that? Just keep in mind my reputation is on the line here. He's paying top dollar for the best driver in Chicago.</line>
    <line id="209187">I'm sick of remembering her that way. It's never a dream of her tiny face pressing the window when she knows I was coming over. Or that wobbly little dance she did. It's always the same nightmare.</line>
    <line id="209189">You can hear me perfectly. You need to stop right now.</line>
    <line id="209190">Yeah, hello? You still there? Can't hear you. Okay, gotta go!</line>
    <line id="209195">I thought you never wanted to meet.</line>
    <line id="209196">I don't. But we need to meet.</line>
    <line id="209213">Hey, did you get anywhere with DedSec? I need those ctOS hacks.</line>
    <line id="209214">Yeah I'm still trying. They're checking you out. Give me time.</line>
    <line id="209217">Oh shit. Someone's hacked in. Fuck me! Lock down the building. Find him now!</line>
    <line id="209240">Okay I got you in. Can you track the caller?</line>
    <line id="209241">I'm searching now. Câlisse! The police are coming. They got high tech scans that are hard to shake. You need to get out of there.</line>
    <line id="209243">Well I certainly don't want to disappoint him.</line>
    <line id="209314">You've reached ... well, you know who you've reached. I'm currently away on business, but my associate is more than happy to help you out.</line>
    <line id="209337">I knew you'd find me. You always were one for a mystery. How are you, Aiden?</line>
    <line id="209338">I hope you don't mind the games. Wanted to see if you'd lost your edge. We need to talk. And you'll want to be quick. Breaking in like you did tripped an alarm. This isn't what I had planned for us, but we're about to be interrupted. Come find me--I'll pick someplace nice.</line>
    <line id="209339">Why would he harass my sister? We haven't spoken since the Merlaut.</line>
    <line id="209340">Let's make this quick, okay? My balcony hosts are moaning and that stuff gives me migraines. I get a migraine, Pearce, and I am useless to you.</line>
    <line id="209341">You think you're the only one who wants this quick?</line>
    <line id="209342">How should I know what you want?</line>
    <line id="209343">Not big on empathy, are you?</line>
    <line id="209344">Not particularly.</line>
    <line id="209348">What?</line>
    <line id="209349">That was his name. Douglas. Ah shit. It's too late.</line>
    <line id="209350">You shot him?</line>
    <line id="209351">I couldn't remember his name. That sucks. I liked that guy. Had lots of rabbi jokes. Fuck me if I can remember a single one of them.</line>
    <line id="209352">That is a terrible plan. I love it. I'll find a map of the joint. Talk you through it once you're inside. Anything you need?</line>
    <line id="209353">My phone.</line>
    <line id="209354">Jesus, you have a problem. You need to unplug.</line>
    <line id="209355">Jordi, I need my phone. They'll confiscate it the second I'm in.</line>
    <line id="209356">Yeah, I know, I'm fucking with you. I got just the guy. He's been begging to settle his debt. You'll get your phone.</line>
    <line id="209357">I don't know, it's cold. I was blindfolded the whole way. I'm scared, Aiden.</line>
    <line id="209358">I know you are. And I'm getting you out. Look, I know Damien. He's not crazy. He won't hurt you. Just be careful around him.</line>
    <line id="209359">What do you mean you know him? He kidnapped me!</line>
    <line id="209362">He's trying to get to me through you.</line>

    <line id="209364">Time's up. My god, what did you say to her? The poor girl's in tears.</line>
    <line id="209365">Damien, put her back on.</line>
    <line id="209366">You want to continue this little chat, you follow that IP address and get me something I can use. Ta-ta.</line>
    <line id="209368">Yeah. I'm...I'm here. Okay, I'll see you soon.</line>

    <line id="209419">No, I'm fine. Nobody's going to miss this dog. This is a good match. He's supposed to pick up his car at a dealership.</line>
    <line id="209420">All right. I'll meet him there.</line>
    <line id="209435">This auto shop's in Mad Mile. Yeah, I'm gonna need to hack the district control center first.</line>
    <line id="209437">All right, that's got it. Now Nicholas Crispin.</line>
    <line id="209438">Shit, I keep forgetting Clara's not used to this. I'm going to scare her off if I'm not careful. Crispin’s my ticket into that auction and my only shot at getting close to Iraq. He needs to disappear.</line>

    <line id="209449">I'm not sure we can add things up so cleanly, but we're gonna get her out.</line>
    <line id="209450">Alright, here I am all monstered-up for the monster ball. Okay, just keep your head, say as little as possible. If Crispin's as fucked up as they say, I'm going to draw attention. Just find the auction invite and get out.</line>
    <line id="209451">Quinn's auction. Iraq's somewhere inside. Security's gonna tight and it won't be long before someone reports my mess at the car dealer's. Just find Iraq, scan his dog tags, and make a clean getaway. Sounds easy enough. Something tells me it's not going to go down that way.</line>
    <line id="209453">Listen ... I'm running on a limited timeline here. The faster we can get this out of the way--</line>
    <line id="209454">I don't think you understand your own conundrum, my friend. Chicago is running on software designed to find people. I know how the ctOS thinks because I'm her deadbeat daddy and she's still carrying my picture in her back pocket. Unless you can clean my biometrics from the system, I am useless to you in Chicago.</line>
    <line id="209455">As for my "art" as you call it -- if you fuck things up for me, I need to be ready for the fallout.</line>
    <line id="209456">Your confidence is encouraging.</line>
    <line id="209461">Nice place. You've got a real eye for ... uh ... art.</line>
    <line id="209509">The first thing I'm gonna need is some of Blume's hardware. I've been out of the loop for a while. I need to figure out how their scanners work.</line>
    <line id="209510">You want me to break into Blume?</line>
    <line id="209511">Not yet. Somebody else already stole the hardware. Inside job. That stuff's big on the black market. I've scouted these guys - let's just say they're big fans of the Second Amendment. Take one of my rifles. You're gonna need it.</line>
    <line id="209515">Good. Cops will find those girls and get them someplace safe. As for those bidders? If any slip past the bust, they'll end up on my plate eventually.</line>
    <line id="209519">It’s all going to shit fast. Gotta get outta here.</line>
    <line id="209527">I was worried Jacks would do this. He's not a kid that sits still. He's got a lot of his uncle in him. He's gone searching for his mother. Where would he go?</line>
    <line id="209531">What the hell is Jackson doing in here? It’s that Racine van. Dammit, he thinks his mother's here. This place is mob-owned. After the auction mess, these guys will be on high security.</line>
    <line id="209540">You kidding, you actually got it?</line>
    <line id="209567">I didn't get much data. I hope we have enough.</line>
    <line id="209568">Yeah, I got it, but they're still on me.</line>
    <line id="209570">I don't know who she is but that's the girl in the video. Iraq says she's dead.</line>
    <line id="209571">Okay thanks...that might help.</line>
    <line id="209576">That wasn't our deal.</line>
    <line id="209577">Oh but it was. You said it's encrypted. Then your job's not done.</line>
    <line id="209578">No. You're not gonna do this.</line>
    <line id="209579">I can do whatever I want.</line>
    <line id="209584">Alright, I left the truck for you.</line>
    <line id="209587">I've been chased by a few. What does that have to do with anything?</line>
    <line id="209588">Call it a hunch. We'll talk soon.</line>
    <line id="209590">Ok, I'm in position. Now what about these helicopters?</line>
    <line id="209591">Wait for it...</line>
    <line id="209593">Go! Don't lose it!</line>
    <line id="209595">Do you have an end goal here?</line>
    <line id="209596">Yeah ... I want to know where it goes.</line>
    <line id="209597">...and that helps us because...</line>
    <line id="209598">Because it's a routine. Blume HQ changes security protocol every day. That bird makes a trip over Pawnee with the new assignments.</line>
    <line id="209599">So basically the chopper's going to lead us to the security chief.</line>
    <line id="209601">It's hovering over a trailer park.</line>
    <line id="209602">Well that doesn't make any sense. Wait a minute--it makes perfect sense! A lot of the Pawnee Militia run security for Blume. And a lot of them live in that pit of paranoia.</line>
    <line id="209603">One of them's the security chief.</line>
    <line id="209607">This is more than just a gun club. They've got control of half the park. Is this normal for Pawnee?</line>
    <line id="209608">Ain't nothing normal in Pawnee. When Blume started dumping money into this place, things took a turn for the weird.</line>
    <line id="209610">We've got our access to Blume HQ now.</line>
    <line id="209611">I'm a realist. Listen--I'm coding a dirty little virus to erase me from their system. Damn, I’m good.</line>
    <line id="209675">Yeah. Well let’s thin their numbers then. You tracking any of their truck deliveries?</line>

    <line id="209942">Okay, you've got my attention. Let's talk about Raymond Kenney.</line>
    <line id="209943">One thing at a time. You should know I've come across some dirt on a few ctOS executives.</line>
    <line id="209944">What kind of dirt?</line>
    <line id="209945">The expensive kind. Relax -this isn't blackmail.</line>
    <line id="209946">If not money, then what?</line>
    <line id="209947">It's simple. You can have the dirt.</line>
    <line id="209949">Very little is simple. What's your price, Mr. Brenks?</line>

    <line id="209952">I know, I know. The people upstairs would never allow it. But they don't have to know.</line>
    <line id="209955">And Kenney is right here in Pawnee. Isn't that convenient?</line>

    <line id="210317">So … since I’m the “ghost of Ray Kenney” simply by desk location, I get to hear everybody’s fucking Ray Kenney story. In one woman’s case, it really was a fucking Ray Kenney story—and that’s an ugly one. I about lost it the first couple of weeks until I realized something--Ray had it all figured out. With his hands in the guts of the ctOS, he began to see the real sinister potential of the thing he built. How do I know this? Because the ghost of Ray Kenney still haunts the data. He knew it would take another engineer to find it, somebody operating on the same level. Well congrats to me, I guess that means I’m one of the smart ones.</line>
    <line id="210360">So here’s my contribution to Ray’s legacy. Apparently, you’ve found me embedded in the system, just like I found him—only I won’t presume mine was as well hidden. It doesn’t matter—I’m long gone, anyway. I’m going to play you some of Ray’s Greatest Hits as well as some of my own. Maybe one day this will all come back to bite Blume in the ass. Probably not. Here, I'll play some Ray:</line>
    <line id="210403">So what’s Blume doing with all our data? I may have sneaked a peek, sorry. Charlotte and her PR brigade aren’t totally lying about how they use it – they’re speeding things up. Making life more convenient, but the right hand doesn’t know what the asshole is doing. Go ahead. Listen:</line>
    <line id="210447">The bosses are talking about the long-term--global ctOS potential, at least in the countries that can afford it. They say it with stars in their eyes. They mention world-changers like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. You almost want to believe them—but then you realize they could actually pull it off. Ray put it best:</line>
    <line id="210490">I’m going to let Ray take this this one:</line>
    <line id="210533">According to my coworkers, they sent security down to escort Ray out like some kind of criminal. He didn’t even get to gather all his things--I still have one of his ugly sculptures on my desk. He kicked and screamed the whole way out which gave Blume all they needed to put an HR spin on it. I’ll read it for you: “We apologize for the disruption caused on Tuesday when we ended our contract with Raymond Kenney. As a reminder, your medical insurance covers psychiatric consultations. We wish Mr. Kenney a speedy recovery and we must stress the continued importance of confidentiality to all Blume employees.” I’ll do my best Ray translation: “Mr. Kenney was batshit crazy and don’t you dare repeat anything he said or your ass is grass.”</line>
    <line id="210576">Ray lashed out and took down the power to most of the Northeast. People panicked. People died. A lot of money was lost. He was making a point. Demonstrating the dangers of relying on one system to keep everything running. Was it terrorism? I guess so. I mean, it’s pretty much the definition, right? Rose Washington, she took a more traditional route in her whistleblowing and picked up a few headlines, but her proximity to Ray quickly discredited her. Tobias Frewer – I don’t think anybody noticed him leave. He just wasn’t there one day. Ray’s still on the run, too. Is he a threat? Blume seems to think so. Every so often, we get an email warning us to report any contact from former employees. But we all know which one they mean.</line>
    <line id="210664">I've been asked to pick up the reins on the prediction software. They call it Bellwether and I suspect it's everything Ray Kenney feared. Just like Ray, I was asked to keep my work between me and a few specific managers. I could go higher up. I could out them and maybe even stop this, but I want to play along a bit more. I want to see where this all is going. Something they can’t deny when it goes public. I can’t believe I’m actually considering whistle-blowing. I hate the spotlight. I’m weighing other options. There’s a hacker group that might be able to do something with this information—they call themselves DedSec.</line>
    <line id="210666">So, I’ve been working on my own “Hello World” for the Bellwether to see if it’s really as insidious as I suspect it is. Does the Fibonacci sequence mean anything to you? It’s always been one of my favorites. I’m going to throw the Fibonacci numbers out there--Bellwether should predict where they can have the most subliminal influence, saturating the city within days. The ctOS will then monitor for impact. If I see instances of those numbers echo back throughout the city--everything I’ve feared would be in motion. At that point, I’m sending proof to DedSec and they can do whatever they do to make things right.</line>
    <line id="210705">Inviting Blume to build ctOS in your city is like inviting a fucking vampire over for dinner and handing him a goddamn straw.</line>
    <line id="210706">The suits are already putting a price on the data they're collecting. They’ve been ro-mancing advertisers and politicians. Shit, the mayor himself had a date with a couple of them last week. None of this comes as a surprise, so why are they hiding all this from the Board of Directors?  There’s something else. Something I’m missing.</line>
    <line id="210707">Imagine every major city, American, European, Asian, whatever, is now the same city. Sharing instant surveillance. Constantly feeding each other data about you. Now mix in the special ingredients – prediction algorithms, feedback loops, subliminal messaging, Christ--I helped them build this thing and I can stop it. This is so big they don’t have all the pieces yet. I still have time to act.</line>
    <line id="210709">Kenney's mine now. But Pawnee. Why does he have to be in Pawnee? Too many bad memories there.</line>
    <line id="210711">I’m on the verge of my third strike now, so they’ve taken away a lot of my access-prepping for my big meltdown, I guess. They’ve handed Rose a new task-—they want to start work on a behavioral prediction system. She’ll never do it. I worry that if they give it to Tobias, he’ll actually pull it off. His OCD cannot resist a challenge. If we’re going to burn this thing, we may have to implicate the poor bastard.</line>
    <line id="210716">Shit shit shit. I checked – the top lottery numbers that people played this month. Fibonacci. I’ve been hearing people talk about them on the L. On the news last night? A blurb about Fibonacci. I don’t even need to read the ctOS report. The Bellwether worked—I sent Fibonacci through the ctOS and the people of Chicago echoed it back. So, I guess this is it. Raymond Kenney was right.</line>
    <line id="210721">I've got what I need. We're ready.</line>
    <line id="210722">You're actually going after Ray Kenney. I can't believe we found him.</line>
    <line id="210723">Haven't found him yet but we're close.</line>
    <line id="210724">He might not even help, you know. If he decrypts those files, he's exposing himself.</line>
    <line id="210725">This guy was a whistleblower. You said those files had blackmail on Blume?</line>
    <line id="210726">There was blackmail on everyone.</line>
    <line id="210727">I think an ex-Blume radical would find that hard to resist.</line>
    <line id="210730">Hello, partner. I was just chatting with Nicky here. Saucy girl.</line>
    <line id="210731">You touch a hair and I'll snap your neck.</line>
    <line id="210732">No surprise you're siblings. She's a hot-head like you.</line>
    <line id="210733">Why are you calling?</line>
    <line id="210734">She's wondering if you're coming to collect her. I said I'd check.</line>
    <line id="210735">I've found someone who can decrypt the data.</line>
    <line id="210736">I'm all ears.</line>
    <line id="210737">His name's Raymond Kenney, an old ctOS developer.</line>
    <line id="210739">He's in Pawnee. I'm heading there now.</line>
    <line id="210740">Well, that is news, but I'm going to use my veto here.</line>
    <line id="210741">What veto? He created the encryption.</line>
    <line id="210742">Raymond Kenney is also a whistleblower. He's going to unlock all those juicy files and put them on the goddamned news--You know what secrets are when they hit the news? Worthless. I'm warning you. Find another way.</line>
    <line id="210743">There is no other way. You want this done, you need to get off my back and let me do it.</line>
    <line id="210752">Damien sounded worried. He's after the blackmail in those files. What's his game? What's he planning to do? I can't let him distract me. Kenney's the answer. He'll help me decrypt everything. And I'll get Nicky safe.</line>
    <line id="210754">Damn. That was sloppy, Pearce. Stay sharp. All right, someone around here received the reset code.</line>
    <line id="210755">Kenney bounced through a ctOS center. Looks like he's still in the game. That would explain why he chose Pawnee--he's sticking it to Blume in their own backyard.</line>
    <line id="210756">So "Jed" is the owner of Jedediah's Bar--Pawnee's #1 watering hole -- maybe the only one. I hope I can catch the man sober.</line>
    <line id="210757">Oh I'm sorry. Am I here to boost your morale? 'Go team, go'? I think you misunderstand our relationship. I see an opportunity. You can help me, I can help you.</line>
    <line id="210758">I think you're missing the point. I found a sad drunk at Jed's Bar, toasting his glory days in private. I'm not an opportunity. I'm your second chance.</line>
    <line id="210759">Well hell, I think I like you -- but it don't make us friends.</line>
    <line id="210760">Could this truck be any slower?</line>
    <line id="210761">Oh crap...well what do we do now?</line>
    <line id="210762">Uh, what's that supposed to mean?</line>
    <line id="210763">I never expected you'd actually GET the damn truck.</line>
    <line id="210767">God-damn, this plan might actually work.</line>
    <line id="210770">I got it! I got the job! Which means yours truly has a parking spot outside Blume's "X" Labs. Billions of dollars, mad science, ok--maybe just regular science, but still, who knows what kind of wild shit I'll get to work on. I still have to sign a mountain of confidentiality paperwork, but I'll tell you all about it when I'm done! YES. Yes yes yes yes yes.</line>
    <line id="210771">Okay people, you ready for this? Frickin' mind control. Seriously, man. That's why they hired a social psychologist, hello. OK, OK, so there's no badass laser or satellite, at least not that I know of, but it's still pretty fucking cool, right? The ctOS - it's collecting information on like ... like everybody. And we get to play with it. Aw, shit-- gotta go. More soon.</line>
    <line id="210772">Well, fuck. My assignment--elect Mayor Rushmore. I'm not kidding. For Blume's profitability, we have to make sure the weasel gets elected. So, all aboard the Rushmore train. Choo choo. Fuck. Just listen to this asshat:</line>
    <line id="210773">Well, people did you vote for Rushmore? If you did, I'm sorry. That was me. This is some heavy, heavy shit. We knew the numbers we'd need for a win when we targeted the population. The ctOS worked out what specific messages people needed to hear and where to display them. Not subliminal, right there in your face. Hell, even I voted for him--of course, management mandated it.</line>
    <line id="210774">So now I need security clearance for Blume HQ.  Everywhere I turn, Blume's involved. These guys are up to something and it's a lot more than ctOS. I hope T-Bone knows what he's doing.</line>
    <line id="210776">Okay, okay, okay, I am stuck right in the middle of a conspiracy-theorist's wet dream. And, to be honest, there's no place I'd rather be. This is fucking awesome. My new job - get inside Rushmore's head. Look, we got the funding we needed, so now there's this new deal. I don't know who is paying, but now, we're going to mess with the Mayor himself. I've got a team of brainstorms at 3:00 and I have some nasty, nasty ideas.</line>
    <line id="210779">With full access.</line>
    <line id="210780">I can hardly wait.</line>
    <line id="210781">You remember that bunch protecting the truck? Same gang. The Pawnee Militia is made up of preppers. Survivalists. Anti-government types. My kind of people--which means they won't fuck around. Cold, dead hands and all that crap.</line>
    <line id="210782">So one of you guys is the newly-crowned security chief.</line>
    <line id="210783">The Pawnee Militia is made of security contractors. That means when they fuck up, they lose business. If I create some fuck-ups, they'll send more men... and that means less of them at Blume.</line>
    <line id="210784">So we used the ctOS to media blitz the mayor. Wherever his eyes landed, we played on his fucking paranoia--showed him stories of cheating wives and how to spot liars. Taught him all the warning signs and then made them seem real. Did it work? Well ... the Bellwether predicted he'd file for divorce within two months. And do you know how long it took? Twenty days. Fuck. Listen to this message, it's... it's epic:</line>
    <line id="210785">What does that mean? I'm walking into the lion's den.</line>
    <line id="210786">Don't be dramatic. You reach their servers, this thing'll work.</line>
    <line id="210787">The what? Who?</line>
    <line id="210788">Nevermind.</line>
    <line id="210789">Okay, we've got a new task. Yeah, just call me Cupid. They want to see if the ctOS can hook our buddy Rushmore up with a booty call. Actually, it's not that simple, you see, they want us to manufacture a relationship for him. And I think it's working, listen to this:</line>
    <line id="210790">What the fuck have I done? I--I can't believe it worked. Oh, shit shit shit. I had no idea they'd push it this far. This shit isn't what I signed up for--deals with the Chicago South Club? I can't even run ... I can't escape the ctOS. Nobody can.</line>
    <line id="210793">Alright, here’s what I know. My Blume leak, Angela, she's an engineer—close to the top. As close as an engineer can get, anyway.  I’m going to see if my source checks out, but this is what I’ve been waiting for. Blume with its pants down and I’ll be able to take credit for the leak. I haven’t told the rest of DedSec yet. Call me selfish, but this is my find. They’ll have to put me on the DedSec council, right? If there really is one.</line>
    <line id="210841">Guess what--the DedSec council? Real. I got called into a chat with six of them. I don’t know how they found out, but I hope you’re not posting anything I’ve told you. These people are fucking scary, man. It’s like talking to college professors, only more paranoid and condescending. I don’t think I’m going to get an invite. Still, they’re keeping me on it for now so we don’t spook my contact. They’re expecting proof, so I’m going to have to push her.</line>
    <line id="210889">As soon as I mentioned Ray Kenney, the DedSec council became real friendly. They invited me to attend an online pow-wow with about 30 other people. I think the ones with "Dave" in their handles are the Council. The Daves debriefed us on a lot of recent DedSec events - the mischief with the bridges, the leaks on those Chicago judges, and the media website hacks. The public stuff. They call it “troop building.” There’s a lot more of it coming soon. The Daves have invited me to a private meeting. Shit, I need to get my nerves under control.</line>
    <line id="210912">The “profiling” system in ctOS, what Ray Kenney was working on—DedSec wants it, and I think they want me to get it for them. They say with access to a tool that powerful, we can preemptively strike anyone targeting us. But if we use Blume's tool, doesn't that make us just like them? Another problem--I haven’t told the Daves yet, but my Blume contact’s gone silent. Fuck, I was so close.</line>
    <line id="210936">The Council haaaates Defalt. They don’t want people with public images, even if the image is a giant rat mask. They stay anonymous for a reason, right. He wanted to be Council, they said no, and he turns on them. Steals their imagery and ideas for his own marketing. He cheapens their message. They say he’s dangerous because he's "in it for the lulz," and he's got money to fund his own attacks.</line>
    <line id="210960">One of our fellow members, “Badboy17” brought an appeal to the council this week. The vigilante on the news – Badboy knows him personally. This guy’s been causing Blume a major headache. Walking right into their control centers, and getting away without a trace. But he’s in some kind of trouble. Something with his family.  They took it to private chat, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up working with this guy.</line>
    <line id="210961">The Council noticed Badboy snooping around in some directories he wasn’t supposed to be in today. He copied over some of our more dangerous ctOS exploits. Normally, he’d get an expulsion, or at least a big slap on the wrist, but we want to see where he goes--so they're letting it happen. They've even opened some doors. As long as Badboy's friend is using these things against Blume, we benefit, right?</line>
    <line id="210968">Let’s pick a name at random ... Ms. Green here currently has two outstanding loans. One for a motorcycle and one for a boob job. She hasn't had time for the motorcycle because the boob job's had a complication. The photos in her private hospital file show a major infection on one of her nipples--you know what, I’m going to do Ms. Green a favor here and corrupt her ctOS file. You understand now? This is only the beginning, kids.</line>
    <line id="210969">As proof, my leak sent me this old audio in the Blume system. This is Raymond Kenney:</line>
    <line id="210980">Yo get out, I’m recording. [Silence 4] A’ight here it is. My legacy. Iraq’s legacy. See Lucky Quinn gets all the respect—fuckin’ skeleton and his goon squad, they’re old Chicago. Still ridin’ the roaring 20s and shit. Got some deals runnin' with the old fuck, but I don't trust him and he don't trust me. Shit at least we speak the same language.</line>
    <line id="211037">Fuckin’ DedSec, right? Bunch of one-percenter kids who ain’t never had to deal with the street. Can they code? Yeah. I’ve seen their work. It’s solid. But they got nothing to back it up. Police come knocking and they’re done. I got bite to back up the bark. Police won’t even step foot in my yard and I don’t need to hide behind no fucking mask. DedSec is a fad. I’m the damn future.</line>
    <line id="211066">[Silence 1.5]Bedbug.[Silence 1]Shit this one hurts man, because he's blood. Shit but the kid is soft. And I ain't just talking about the 300-plus he carries, either - shit he takes a lot of shit from the V’s and he takes even more shit from Gramma.[Silence 2] Shit if my cuz wasn't there to intercept, I think I would’ve killed the crazy bitch by now. See Bug seems to have my back, but, but shit I don't know how much longer I can have his.</line>
    <line id="211095">The ctOS is the best thing Blume could have done for Chicago’s uh… entrepreneurs. Police got an eye on every corner, which means they pick up all the small-time players who don’t know no better. Cuts away my competition. But if you know what I know— and if you can do what I can do—you take their hardware and you use it to protect yourself. Shit my little castle here? It’s got state-o-the-art security – paid for by the giving taxpayers of Chicago. Thank you, everybody.</line>
    <line id="211124">Hell it’s better for me if everybody thinks the V’s are a bunch of dumb-ass thugs. Some of them are, for sure. They’re my decoys. I run them low-level on the streets, let them tag, bag, and bang. But my crew, my real fam—I train em with the shit I brought back from the desert: Tactics, psychology, SIGINT. Anybody gets close to Rossi-Fremont, they’re going to see what they want to see--drugs, guns and theft. But upstairs ... [Silence 2]</line>
    <line id="211179">Lucky still thinks every problem can be solved by a gun. He needs to wise up. This “vigilante” that’s doggin’ everyone – that’s the new kind of killa we’re up against. See a gun is just a solution to a specific problem – shit when you need to kill somebody fast. Shit but what if you never see him? What if the dude can destroy you before you ever meet him? See I ain’t goin’ out like that, but I got front row seats if he’s taking out the Club. But me … my shit is protected. That bitch won’t touch me.</line>
    <line id="211180">Well it worked....except the militia's coming for you.</line>
    <line id="211181">Some days I should listen to the voice in my head that says stay in bed.</line>
    <line id="211182">Some days, yeah...</line>
    <line id="211183">Upstairs, up in my court, we’re playin’ the game on a higher level. Police think we’re watching the streets. Shit, we’re watching the whole damn city and the things we find – that’s currency we’ll cash in when we need it. I’ve got dirt on everybody. Quinn, the police. You just watch, I'll get the Mayor, too. I just gotta wait for that perfect moment. And it’s comin’ soon.</line>
    <line id="211185">Damien gave up T-Bone. He said he'd stop me and he's actually trying. He won't win this one.</line>
    <line id="211186">So if I catch a bullet ... if somebody finds this ... you make sure everybody knows what I was. Shit I was nothing, I came from nothing, I got nothing, never asked for shit nothing. But now ... [Silence 4] Well, you watch the news. I did that. By. My. Self. [Silence 3]' the fuck did you ever do?</line>
    <line id="211187">Well I've got my little band of misfits. Clara’s on the monitors. T-Bone’s helping me breach Iraq's fortress. And Jordi--well ... Jordi does what Jordi does. Okay, it's time to see what Iraq's been protecting.</line>
    <line id="211341">I've found something curious. Something called the Bellwether. I don't have a lot on it, but the name popped up during my review of the Merlaut job. Far as I can tell, it's some kind of code inside ctOS. The term bellwether basically means a harbinger of the future. What a puzzling name for some code inside a smart city. I know my programmers. They over-think everything. That name is deliberate. My curiosity has been piqued.</line>
    <line id="211343">No Bedbug this time. I'm going in alone. I've seen the layout, I know the room. Iraq's in there somewhere and it won't take him long to realize I'm coming. He knows what I'm after now. This time I leave with everything.</line>
    <line id="211350">You're absolutely right.</line>
    <line id="211351">I'm watering your plant.</line>
    <line id="211352">Maurice? Put him on.</line>
    <line id="211354">What -- what? Who is this?</line>
    <line id="211355">If you don't talk, you don't leave.</line>
    <line id="211356">Oh no. Come on, please. I got no name. You don't understand. I'm trapped. I can't stop it. I can't stop seeing that little girl. She's just, she's just looking at me.</line>
    <line id="211357">Shut up.</line>
    <line id="211359">I said shut up!</line>
    <line id="211360">All right, weepy. Back to your corner. Jesus, Pearce what did you say to him?</line>
    <line id="211361">You'll meet me there. Rossi-Fremont.</line>
    <line id="211362">Course. I'll be in place.</line>
    <line id="211364">The man was sitting on a tinderbox of blackmail, but he was after something bigger. He was the second hacker and wanted the video from the Merlaut. And someone was desperate to protect it.</line>
    <line id="211365">Whatever game he’s playing, this “Defalt” is putting Nicky’s life at risk. He picked the wrong time to piss me off. But right now, I gotta stall Damien.</line>
    <line id="211366">I don't have the data. Damien will know the second he sees me. But maybe I can make that work for me. He told Blume he'd deliver what we found including the blackmail Iraq has on them. He's painted himself into a corner.</line>
    <line id="211367">Hey we're looking good here. I rebooted the backup. That'll get the bunker chugging in no time.</line>
    <line id="211368">I just talked to Nicky.</line>
    <line id="211369">Your sister? She doing okay? We're gonna get her back.</line>
    <line id="211370">I think know how to find her. I heard a PA sound in our call. Way in the background. The voice said something. A name or a place. You think you can clean the audio? Try to make out what he's saying?</line>
    <line id="211371">Audio wizardry ain't my thing. Send me whatcha got. I'm sure I can do something.</line>
    <line id="211372">Okay I'm heading back to the bunker.</line>
    <line id="211373">No no no no no! We got one more job. You won't believe what I found: Defalt's loveshack. Let's take back what he stole from us.</line>
    <line id="211374">We've got Defalt's location. Now I'll take back what he stole. If he sells Iraq's blackmail on the open market, this has all been for nothing. Whether it disappears or it goes public, I'll have nothing left to offer Damien.</line>
    <line id="211406">The kid's got fixers working for him. Whatever alarm we tripped sent these guys running. The fuckers came pretty fast.</line>
    <line id="211407">Just stay low. I'll get you clear.</line>
    <line id="211408">I found something in his computer. Besides that funky prototype shit. Now, where the hell'd he find that? Man, if I had just 10 minutes more.</line>
    <line id="211409">What did you find?</line>
    <line id="211410">Huh?</line>
    <line id="211411">On his computer.</line>
    <line id="211412">Right. A weakness! I found a weakness in there. He's carrying the data with him. Like on his person. As a security measure I guess, but he ain't as secure as he'd like to think.</line>
    <line id="211413">What are you saying? We find him, we can steal the data back?</line>
    <line id="211414">And he won't know it. Thinks he can fuck with Raymond Kenney. He has no idea who he's up against.</line>
    <line id="211415">The Ambrose. Nicky and I used to catch a movie here. Now it's just some dance club. Defalt must know we tripped his alarm. 
Yeah, he's probably expecting me.</line>
    <line id="211416">Damn he’s good. Look at that, he’s hacked into the Profiler system. He’s toying with me. Go ahead and keep it up, kid.</line>
    <line id="211417">Again with the fixers. Those guys aren't cheap. Defalt's in over his head. He has no idea.</line>
    <line id="211424">So I’m gonna record this—but oh, shit, almost dropped it. [Silence 2] Still going? Ok. Gonna record my legacy like my cuz Iraq’s always doing. Gotta have something to leave behind, just in case—you know. See, Iraq’s got it all figured out, got everybody figured out but me. Why's he always doggin' me? We're blood! We're family! I should be right up there by his side. I gotta find a way to show him that.</line>
    <line id="211445">Iraq’s got the V’s split into two groups. We’re the ones out running his shit and we only get two ways out: in a box or under locks. His fam up there on the top floor, though, these motherfuckers, man – they got an escape plan. They’re keeping all the money ... and the secrets. They don’t give a fuck what happens to any of us. I need to get in on that.</line>
    <line id="211476">Who the fuck is this guy? Shit. He’s not Club—Club don’t do that. I mean. What-what-what was he? A cop? Why would a cop go to all this trouble?  Dude’s gonna get me killed, man. Some of those videos – how did he get them? I never even saw him. Dude, dude must've been following me the whole time,but- but how? Look man I gotta run. I just gotta leave town. [Silence 3] but man, I can’t leave Gramma. [Silence 6]Shit.</line>
    <line id="211477">Okay, I've got him now. Just keep in range and T-Bone will hack in.</line>
    <line id="211483">Damn, Ray. I am so sorry about your car. How much of it did you have to take apart to find my flash drive? Did you find all six decoys? The ball's in your court now -- I just want to point out that I've already done the car thing, so you can leave my baby alone. Please.</line>
    <line id="211484">Nice work, Frewer. I always took you for a prude, but I guess not if you've found my file. I hope you enjoyed your little web tour through the foulest sphincters of the internet. I wonder, did you prefer the testicle torture or the pony dress-up?  Your turn.</line>
    <line id="211486">Awww, Ray. You found my file! I was getting used to it raining men in the bunker 24/7. And in your car. And your mp3 player.  And in every store you visit.  If you ever want the track, I'd be happy to copy it for you. You're up.</line>
    <line id="211487">Congrats! You found my file. I've had a lot of fun with this one--I hate to spoil it. But them's the rules. Fine. Listen, Frewer--nobody's really chasing you. Those black vans that have been following you: Me and Rose. We hid the bugs and cams in your house--can't believe you found every one of them. By the way, you need to re-shingle your roof. I damn near slipped off and killed myself. Your turn, buddy.</line>
    <line id="211488">Hey, buddy. I got good news. I think I got a future as an audio wizard.</line>
    <line id="211489">You cleaned up the audio I sent.</line>
    <line id="211490">Have a listen.</line>
    <line id="211491">Nicky's call came from the same place as that little public address.</line>
    <line id="211492">Brent Ulster. This is good. I'll run a search on his workplace.</line>
    <line id="211496">I know some of it. What do you see?</line>
    <line id="211497">It's everyone. City officials, Union reps. I got phony contracts, payoffs. What in Christ....? Sex logs, a lot of online blackmail. Wait a minute... we got ctOS here...</line>
    <line id="211498">This kid Iraq's been pretty busy. He's got some solid documents here. Looks like ctOS execs used the network to rig their election. Get their boy Rushmore into office.</line>
    <line id="211499">A lot of secrets here. Blackmail shit. It just keeps on coming. What exactly are we looking for here?</line>
    <line id="211500">A video. It's a woman. She's dead now but something about that video was dangerous enough to attack me and my family.</line>
    <line id="211501">Brent Ulster. Report to the office. Brent Ulster.</line>
    <line id="211504">There...Nicky's there, I know it.</line>
    <line id="211506">Go get her back, brother.</line>
    <line id="211507">All right. You stay close just like that. I can worm into his files and he won't even know.</line>
    <line id="211508">It's coming in! Well shit. You seen what's in this data?</line>
    <line id="211509">A corrupt Chicago mayor. That's a surprise.</line>
    <line id="211510">I can't even tell how they rigged it. No voter fraud. They used some crazy code here. I don't know what I'm looking at.</line>
    <line id="211511">I've found Nicky. Finally. And Damien doesn't know. Just move carefully. He'll have her guarded. I hope she's ready to move.</line>
    <line id="211514">Jed, let's do this thing. I'm gonna. I'm gonna send you a ping. If it lands ... we are golden.</line>
    <line id="211515">Are you OK, man? Where are you?</line>
    <line id="211516">In the old c ... t... o... ssssssss center. Just tell me if it pings. Okay, here we go.</line>
    <line id="211517">Ping!</line>
    <line id="211518">Hallelujah! My friend, I owe you a drink.</line>
    <line id="211519">I don't need a drink. I own a bar.</line>
    <line id="211520">Oh yeah. Jedediah's Bar. That's you! Jedediah. In that case, you owe me a drink, buddy.</line>
    <line id="211524">Nicky, it's me.</line>
    <line id="211525">Aiden! Where are you? There's men everywhere. The guard here -- he just -- I don't know what happened.</line>
    <line id="211526">Listen, I know. I'm getting you out. We're gonna stay on the phone and I'm gonna walk you out.</line>
    <line id="211527">No! They'll find me.</line>
    <line id="211528">Nicky, there's a gun there. I want you to pick it up. Just in case.</line>
    <line id="211530">Oh god, this is crazy. Aiden, I don't know guns.</line>
    <line id="211533">He's -- I shot him.</line>
    <line id="211534">We gotta move. Listen to my voice.</line>
    <line id="211535">I think I killed him.</line>
    <line id="211536">Nicky! Listen to me. We're gonna move now.  I'm gonna guide you every step.</line>
    <line id="211539">Just make a run for that car. Get in and drive. Don't look back.</line>
    <line id="211540">I worked so hard to keep Nicky shielded from everything and now...she's killed someone. The whole damn city's collapsing around us. I need to get her away, safe, before it's too late.</line>
    <line id="211543">My blood wants to mix with hers.  We are veins to the same heart. Blood to the beast.  I hurt it here. I hurt it bad. But it's too strong.</line>
    <line id="211544">It doesn't have hands, it has them. It has fingers. I am one, but I am not part of the body. She was. She ... was.</line>
    <line id="211545">Blind the eyes. It opens more, but it is slow. I am not slow. Even if they say. I am NOT slow. I am faster than the eyes. Than the blood.</line>
    <line id="211546">This is wrong. It's wrong. My head says it. My heart. But it's in there. It lies. She lied, too. They all lie for him.</line>
    <line id="211547">There is no Heaven or Hell. Just him or nothing. I give them nothing. Mercy. It's all I can do.</line>
    <line id="211554">It's close now. Almost here. I don't have time. It wants me to hurt real people. I have to cut the tongue. I have to make it quiet.</line>
    <line id="211556">Give us 30 seconds.</line>
    <line id="211557">For what?</line>
    <line id="211558">30 seconds inside ctOS. We drop in our code. Then when the sytem reboots, DedSec will control the machine from inside. We will correct what Blume has broken. 30 seconds is all we need.</line>
    <line id="211559">30 seconds, no one knows. Our little secret?</line>
    <line id="211560">We will be the watchdogs.</line>
    <line id="211562">I've left the package for you where we discussed. This is just a sample. Try them out--get a good feel. We'll call back in a few weeks and see if you want to make a deal.</line>
    <line id="211568">They picked up the drop. We're already seeing six of the weapons have been fired multiple times. We'll run those against recent crime scenes and see how many match.</line>
    <line id="211569">I understand we're going for convictions here, but why aren't we tracking the weapons for crime prevention? I don't like playing clean-up crew.</line>
    <line id="211570">A pickup got lifted before the target could claim it.  I can't wait to find out where this leads. Let's hope for a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, or at least a major bust.</line>
    <line id="211571">One of our guns was used to shoot a seven year old. Sure, if it wasn't one of ours, it would have been another gun. I get that, but that doesn't make me feel less responsible. I guess at least now we have a solid lead on who did it.</line>
    <line id="211572">Obviously, we won't be able to use any tracking information in court, our tactics have to remain a secret for now. I don't even think there's a precedent for this kind of thing. But it does tell us exactly what went down and points us at the right target.</line>
    <line id="211573">The Merlaut Hotel. This is where it started. My whole world crushed because of this place. Because of Lucky Quinn. He ordered the attack on me, on my family. Well he's going to tell me why. Then he's going to die.</line>
    <line id="211575">I'm worried about where our guns ended up. I mean, the CPD is using the ctOS itself to track the chips in these things--with Blume's help, no less. What happens if these "fixers" expose what they found. Shit ... what if they fuck with the data? We got some solid busts, but we need to abandon this operation.</line>

    <line id="211586">What has she done? Why would she call Damien?</line>
    <line id="211589">[Silence 1] Hello, Aiden. I can't decide where to begin. The first time I saw you, you were playing chess with Jackson in the park. Both of you still very sad from the -- funeral. I could see how you made him feel safe. In our world we hide in the dark, behind monitors. That's the only place we feel safe. It isn't enough to say that I didn't know. That lives would be lost or that it was only a job. I thought if I could help you heal, help you find answers -- maybe I could heal myself. But I can't. When this is all over, I hope we can at least talk. Or if not... at least I can disappear. That's something I'm good at.</line>
    <line id="211590">What have I done? I brought this on Clara. And all of this comes down to blackmail. A six year old girl dies because an old man wants to protect his secrets and Blume -- they can spin all they want to the press, but their hands are bloody. I'm done with secrets.</line>

    <line id="211834">That was a mistake. I screwed up big. I just wanted to get out. That’s all. Clean break, me and Abbie. Oh god how could I do this. These guys got eyes everywhere. They know everything. They told me every fucking thing I bought at the grocers. The fucking ctOS! [Silence 1.7]Guy called, and said if I try it again, they’ll kill my wife. [Silence 1.1]Just like that. Like some small inconvenience to him. About my wife. [Silence 1.4]I never told her. [Silence 1.5]But she kept pushing me. [Silence 0.7]Let’s go, we need to leave town. She thinks I’m getting pulled back into the life. [Silence 2.2]She had no idea how right she was.</line>
    <line id="211835">I took the job. I had no choice. I had to protect Abbie. [Silence 0.5]They would’ve killed her. [Silence 0.6]Said it was a small job. Some tech lab out West in the middle of nowhere. [Silence 1]Place was deserted. No one, no lights. It was pitch black. I’m doing lookout with binoculars. But there’s no one. [Silence 0.8]My partner’s covering the South. [Silence 0.6]We were there at least 3 hours and there’s fuck-all but wild rabbits. [Silence 0.9]Then he says pack it up. Saying, job’s over. So I’m thinking, shit I fucked up. [Silence 1.2]Then he said it went better than expected. I go back and he gives me an extra $200 bucks for a job well done. [Silence 1.7]I mean, what the fuck is that, hey? [Silence 0.6]These guys, man. [Silence 0.6]How can you trust guys like that?</line>
    <line id="211836">What did I just do? What was I thinking? Fuck. [Silence 0.8] They, [Silence 1.2]they gave me a bigger job this time. Wanted me to follow on some job. A guy skipped out on them and they found him. [Silence 0.5]These guys wanted me to see what happens. A warning. The guy had just enough time to recognize them and they were all over him. Two fucking teeth landed at my feet. [Silence 1.3]I’ve seen this before. Done it before. [Silence 0.7] Wasn’t gonna let it rattle me. And they knew it. So they just kept beating him. [Silence 0.8]Then he stops making any human sounds. Just, like, wheezing. Like [Silence 2]–like a... like a fucking pig. [Silence 0.8]And they just kept going. I just said – I said it. ‘Stop! He’s fucking dead already!’ [Silence 1.8]And the one guy just stares at me. [Silence 1.3]And he keeps kicking him. [Silence 1]Looking right at me the whole time. He says, [Silence 1.8]“How’s the wife?”</line>
    <line id="211837">I been stuck in a cold sweat for over a week. [Silence 1] I blew that last job and I was expecting a hit any second. [Silence 1.9]Abbie is freaking out around me. We’d been shouting a lot. She thought I was getting seduced by the life. Fuck me. [Silence 1.3]Fuck. [Silence 0.9]I couldn’t tell her the truth. I had to do whatever they wanted. I had no choice. [Silence 0.5]These guys were gonna come and kill her. [Silence 1.3]So I said I’d take another job. Only this time they didn’t want to fuck around. They had a hit lined up. Some guy, Aiden Pearce. Never heard the name before. [Silence 0.9]And I was going to be the trigger man. [Silence 1]I couldn’t say no. [Silence 0.9]This was the only offer on the table. This was my get out of jail free card. [Silence 1.7]And I took it.</line>
    <line id="211838">No no no no – what happened? [Silence 1]Why was she staring at me?  Fuck me, [Silence 0.9]everything just fell apart. [Silence 1.4]I found Pearce, ID'd his car, I rode up beside him, it was... [Silence 0.6]it was just gonna be quick. [Silence 1.6]Shot to the temple and I’m home free. [Silence 1.7]Then this kid – [Silence 1]just some little girl. [Silence 1.3]She holds this stuffed toy out the window. [Silence 0.8]She's staring right at me. [Silence 1.4]I got the fucking gun in my hand. I couldn’t do it. [Silence 1.5]I couldn’t shoot him. [Silence 1.2]So I pulled the gun to his front tire and shot it out. [Silence 1.4]I didn’t know what I hoped was gonna happen. I only know they crashed, [Silence 1.8]and that little girl died. [Silence 2]I killed her.</line>
    <line id="211839">They've taken Abbie.[Silence 1] At first I thought she just left me. [Silence 0.5]I'm a dead-beat fuck up, [Silence 0.5] I couldn't blame her. I checked her work. Her friends. [Silence 0.5]No one's heard from her. [Silence 1]And then those bastards called me again. [Silence 1.5]They said I screwed up the Pearce job. [Silence 1.5]No more chances. [Silence 0.5] I begged him not to kill her. I begged him to kill me instead. [Silence 0.5]And the sonofabitch says he was feeling generous. [Silence 0.5]He wasn't gonna kill her. He's gonna send her to an auction instead. The fucking auctions. [Silence 1.5]How do I get her out of that? [Silence 0.5]They got tracking shit on the girls. [Silence 1]Get them so fucked up on smack they don't even remember their names. Oh christ, Abbie. [Silence 3]The sick fuck who called me -- [Silence 1.5]he said the debt was clean. [Silence 1.4]I was free to live my life. [Silence 1.9]What fucking life have I got?</line>

    <line id="212014">It's 3AM and I'm in hospital. My legs are busted. One pretty bad. Doctor says it won't come back 100%. Apparently I've been here a week. I only remember the night they attacked. I barely reached my front door and these guys were on me. I figured to rob my house, but the police tell me they never entered the building. Just beat me unconscious and left. Cops asked if I had enemies. Where to begin. My guess is the Merlaut job. We rattled somebody's cage. What was that video I saw? Whatever it was, someone wants to keep it secret.</line>
    <line id="212029">Aiden and I weren't the only people raiding the Merlaut Hotel that night. Someone else was snooping inside. But he wasn't after cash. He was after data. He knew precisely what he wanted. That video. How did he know it was there? I don't even know if he got it. He probably had to run once the alarms went off. If I can track him down, I might get some answers on who attacked me.</line>
    <line id="212039">The woman, yes. I told you not to go for the kid. Did you think I'd actually pay you more? Now you've complicated things.</line>
    <line id="212040">[laughs] I didn't send him. But I probably should have warned you about Aiden.</line>
    <line id="212041">That's exactly why you don't know anything. He's not going to be happy when he finds that out.</line>
    <line id="212042">I saw my old partner in the paper this morning. "The driver, Aiden Pearce 38, lost control of his vehicle in the Pawnee underpass. His young niece, Lena Pearce was killed in the crash." Poor girl. But Aiden doesn't lose control of vehicles. That was no accident. And the timing's interesting. Same week as my attack. Right after our job at the Merlaut. That's going to upset Aiden. He's a smart hacker, I taught him that. But he's a vengeful sonofabitch. You piss him off, he won't let you go. You kill his niece -- god rest your soul.</line>

    <line id="212067">Well that was easy. I've found our secret hacker. My legs may be shot, but I haven't lost my touch at the keyboard. He's hiding inside Rossi-Fremont, some little ghetto corner of Chicago. Welfare, drugs -- they're revolting creatures you keep at arms length. One of these creatures snuck inside the Merlaut server. Maybe I'll find that video on his computer. Problem is I can't break in remotely. I need someone to go inside. Someone more street-savvy than me. Someone like Aiden. Unfortunately, he won't work with me anymore. He's made that pretty clear.</line>
    <line id="212069">I've been reading lots on Chicago's new vigilante. He seems to have popped out of nowhere. Most interesting, he arrived on the scene soon after Aiden's car crash. Isn't that curious? The two share a self-righteous anger. Could it really be him? Aiden's always been a dangerous fighter. I cleaned him up good and taught him how to breach a network. But he always had that hair trigger rage. You can never take the street punk out of a man like Aiden. I suppose being the vigilante gives him a safe outlet.</line>
    <line id="212071">Well well, the police are in quite a frenzy. The vigilante's twisted their panties in a knot. If I were to psycho-analyze Aiden, I'd say he's projecting. He can't fix the death of his niece, so he's fixing all other injustices littering our streets. Maybe that helps scratch the itch, but it doesn't answer the question that must be nagging at him. Who killed his niece? One thing I've learned about Aiden -- he's got a rabid protective streak. Tinker with his family at your peril. I wonder. Maybe I can tempt him. Give him a way to avenge the little girl. And I get what I want.</line>

Something beyond simple vengeance. Something memorable. I'll need to be careful. If I involve Aiden, he can't know my motives. The man's reckless, self-centered, but he's got a curiously strong moral compass. It's a terrible weakness. Makes him hard to control. I just need to find a way into that code. See what they're doing inside ctOS, then cripple it all.</line>

    <line id="212425">The auction's all set. Tenth one in ten years. And this time it's mostly American product. I expect that to drive the prices up. I hope so. Security's been expensive. The police don't like domestic merchandise. It's too risky for them, bad PR if word gets out. I honestly don't care where the product comes from myself, but the clientele -- well, they have particular tastes. They've complained enough for years. Eventually I have to cater to their wishes or I lose their business. Or worse, my reputation.</line>
    <line id="212426">This year I'm handing over the auction security to Iraq and his men, the Viceroys. They've done well distributing our drugs to the addicts of the Wards. I promised Iraq I'd reward him if he came through for us. Well, he has. So his men will run security for the entire event. If all goes well, I'll never have to supply any of my own men in the future. The further I can distance myself, the better. By next year, perhaps I can skip the event myself. I've always found it a distasteful affair. Men and their libidos. It's a weakness I've never entertained.</line>
    <line id="212427">I was at City Hall today for my monthly fireside chat with Mayor Rushmore. I do enjoy walking the hallowed halls, marking my territory so to speak. The Mayor's been a good soldier, never complained. Always understood his role. He holds the reins to the city, but I ride the carriage. This meeting was interesting. We met with someone from a company called Blume. They have plans to turn Chicago into America's first smart city. As they explain it, this would mean everything public and private would run through a central computer. I don't understand the technicalities, but I do understand an opportunity. I gave the Mayor my blessing to proceed.</line>
    <line id="212428">ctOS has been an impressive project. The Mayor masterfully sold it to Chicago, and they bought it all. Why not? Save the public a couple pennies, offer a few treats, and they'll fall to their knees in worship. I financed most of this project and Blume has held up their end of the deal. I've never had such easy access to the secrets of my enemies. If one thing concerns me, it's the Mayor. Quite suddenly he's a man of the people -- reading too many editorials I suppose. If this continues, we'll need to have a chat.</line>
    <line id="212429">What an interesting meeting. My regular Blume contact brought along an Italian programmer named Desipio. He proposed a solution to our Mayor Rushmore problem. I'm not sure I believe it, but if it works then ctOS will become the most powerful weapon I've ever owned. It seems they can program the system to target precise results such as, let's say, the re-election of our Mayor Rushmore.He's a very unpopular man right now and the election's coming. I've instructed this Desipio, yeah, to prove his software works. I need Rushmore in office. If he can do it, then we'll consider solutions to keeping the Mayor in line.</line>
    <line id="212430">Rushmore's become a thorn in my side. Ever since winning the re-election, he's under the illusion he works for the people. He's actually trying to follow through on campaign promises. Regulate ctOS? It's time to bring our mayor in line permanently. I've instructed Blume to use ctOS and arrange some blackmail I can use. A dead hooker, underage boy, I don't care, but I told them I want it soon. To their credit, they never blinked. They're going to use the same software they used for the election. A bellwether of some kind. Amazing what can happen when everyone's suitably motivated.</line>
    <line id="212432">I now own the Mayor. It took eight weeks. ctOS began targeting our beloved mayor daily. And a mere 48 days later, I had my blackmail. That's impressive. And so is the material. Absolutely scandalous if it gets out. I've already shown the Mayor its contents and he agrees. He's ruined in every sense if anyone sees it. But I must protect the material. If it ever went public, it would be worthless to me. What good is blackmail if it's not a secret? The mayor must live in constant fear that I "might" leak it. It's what keeps him answering my every whim.</line>

    <line id="212950">Badboy17 ... definitely didn't grow up in Chicago--he's not faking the accent. French, but not from France. Probably French-Canadian. DedSec appeals to middle-class malcontents--it's possible he came down for the ctOS protests and stayed close to the source. But DedSec is about anonymous rebellion - why does he want to meet? I'll shake him off his game and see what he's hiding.</line>
    <line id="212951">Blume hires private contractors to guard their ctOS centers. These guys will be geared up and wired for action. But I'll be ready.</line>
    <line id="212953">I used to look up to Damien—he taught me how to ferret out weak code and exploit it. But I taught him how to do the same without a computer--people can be more vulnerable than their systems. We were a strong team. After Lena, I was done with him. I didn't waste time thinking about him. But now he's creeping back in...I need to know what he's got on the Merlaut.</line>
    <line id="212954">Where is he? Jordi can be a pain to work with, but he's the devil I know. If things were different, I might be hunting him down--or vice versa. But if he says we've got a problem, I need to take it as a massive understatement. I can't let this survivor ID me or everything is going to spiral out of control.</line>
    <line id="212955">Palin Correctional Center. They recently upgraded the place with Blume's state-of-the-art security: networked locks, automated surveillance. If they were holding the guy in an older prison, I'd have a problem, but Blume's right on this one - they do make life easier through technology.</line>
    <line id="212956">I'm putting a lot of trust in Jordi here. If I don't get in with my phone, I'll be delivering myself to the police without a fight.  He'll come through. He always does. Then it's on me to deliver my message inside.</line>
    <line id="212958">That plan actually worked. My identity's safe. Now -- Lena's attackers. I want the one responsible. Damien bragged about a second hacker. Someone else inside the Merlaut. I need to find out what Damien knows...</line>
    <line id="212959">Everything I owned was in that damn motel, including any lead I had for Damien. I can work offline, but not fast enough. I know Clara can help, that’s not the issue. Do I want to risk putting her in the line of fire again?  That’s her call. She knows what I am now.</line>
    <line id="212961">The Viceroys repurposed the city's security to protect themselves. That’s impressive, but cocky. They won't expect me to use their own trick against them. I'll tap in from the Bunker and see what they're hiding inside Rossi-Fremont.</line>
    <line id="212962">I just bought Bedbug the reputation he always wanted. Now I need to scare him over to my side. A little blackmail threat should convince him to help me. I give ... but I can also take away.</line>
    <line id="212964">If T-Bone's coming with me to Chicago, I gotta breach the building. Blume's head office. Security specialists. It's not going to be easy. And I'm a giant blip on their radar. But once I'm done here, I've got Raymond Kenney in my back pocket.</line>
    <line id="212965">Dammit! Damien’s going to fuck this all up—why can’t he see that? We need Ray Kenney … gotta get him out of this!</line>
    <line id="212971">Quinn's dead. This is the part where I'm supposed to say I feel empty, right? I’d be lying to myself. I finally feel awake...like I can breathe again. And Lena? Nothing can change her death. But maybe I can still do something that will make a difference.</line>

    <line id="217246">So let's take a look.</line>
    <line id="217251">Online Contract - Chicago</line>
    <line id="217253">All right, Jacks. Where the hell are you?</line>
    <line id="217259">These guys are trying to pull a drive-by shooting. I'm gonna stop them before they get there.</line>
    <line id="217260">This asshole's going to attack somebody's family to send a warning. This one's personal. I've gotta get this guy.</line>
    <line id="217261">What kind of reckless animal firebombs a home with children? It's guys like these that just need to disappear. And I'm happy to oblige.</line>
    <line id="217262">Done and done. Requiescat in pace.</line>
    <line id="217263">This guy's involved in some heavy shit--patented genomes, genetic memory manipulation, sketchy pharmaceuticals. All that fueled by an unhealthy dose of corporate corruption. Sometimes they just fall right onto my plate.</line>
    <line id="217264">A delivery job. I can do that. Clean plates and no damage. I'll hit the back alleys and shortcuts.</line>
    <line id="217265">So they need a car delivered fast. With minimal damage. That's right in my wheelhouse. I'll hit some shortcuts for good measure.</line>
    <line id="217266">Let's see, I gotta get these wheels delivered with minimal damage. And they want it fast. If there's one thing I like in a car, it's fast.</line>
    <line id="217267">I think I'll pay this guy a little visit. I doubt he'll like my little visit. But it'll give him something to think about in the hospital.</line>
    <line id="217268">This asshole is mine. He wants to beat a woman? He'll be eating through a straw when I'm done with him.</line>
    <line id="217269">This guy sounds like a real piece of work. He's lucky I'm in a good mood. I won't kill him. Maybe I'll just break his legs.</line>
    <line id="217270">Got a feeling about this one. I'm going to find him and run him through the Profiler.</line>
    <line id="217271">I'm going to find this guy and profile him. Something seems off.</line>
    <line id="217272">This guy's up to something. I'm going to tail him.</line>
    <line id="217276">All right, the contract's after data. I gotta find it and decrypt it. Looks like I'm not the only one after it. I'll need to be fast.</line>
    <line id="217277">Hmm, there's a few fixers chasing the same contract. We're all after encrypted data. I'll just have to be faster. Find it, decrypt it and the contract's mine.</line>
    <line id="217278">So this job's a hunt for data. Encrypted data I need to decrypt. I'll need to watch for fixers. This is an open contract. I'm sure I'll have competition.</line>
    <line id="217279">Well, I think I can do better next time.</line>
    <line id="217280">Not my best finish. Next time.</line>
    <line id="217281">That was a bit of a clusterfuck. I'll need to do better.</line>
    <line id="217282">Nice. That worked our beautifully.</line>
    <line id="217283">Yeah. That's the way to do it.</line>
    <line id="217284">There we go. Nice and clean.</line>
    <line id="217285">I really blew that contract.</line>
    <line id="217286">What was I thinking? Get your head right, Aiden.</line>
    <line id="217287">Made a real mess out of that one.</line>
    <line id="217291">Damn. I'll have to end it. And I was just getting started.</line>
    <line id="217292">Ah hell. I’m gonna have to shut this down.</line>
    <line id="217293">Well that's the end of that. I'll have to try again later.</line>
    <line id="217294">Alright, this hacker knows how it works ... he's fair game.</line>

    <line id="217297">Seems like the threat's gone. Now where was I?</line>

    <line id="217302">Damn, there's a fixer tailing me. Let's deal with that right now.</line>
    <line id="217303">That's a fixer on me. I gotta deal with him right away.</line>
    <line id="217304">Damn. I got a fixer on me. I better find him fast.</line>

    <line id="218595">You finished [Position]</line>
    <line id="218597">All right. Now I can deal with Jordi's job. Some kind of driving contract. Deliver a guy somewhere. This won't be a typical taxi service. The trick with these jobs is avoiding the cops.</line>
    <line id="218601">Okay, I gotta find some stolen car and reach a drop-off point. The trick is to avoid the cops.</line>
    <line id="218602">Looks like I'm after an abandoned getaway car. The cops will be running a search for it. I should ride back alleys and short cuts.</line>
    <line id="218603">So this is a recovery job. Cleaning up someone else's shitty work. Once I find these wheels, I'll need to watch my back. I'm sure someone's looking for this car.</line>
    <line id="218604">My target's made some powerful enemies, so this guy's going to be moving fast. I need to track him down and take him out.</line>
    <line id="218607">All right, this job's a data download. Some of these targets have stolen some data. I gotta find it, retrieve it, and take these guys out.</line>
    <line id="218608">Contract's clear. I need to find and erase these guys before they can get away...</line>
    <line id="218609">Okay, I need to retrieve some missing code. I'll have to find the guy who stole it. I'll download the data. Then I'll bring down the thief.</line>

    <line id="219005">Sometimes I wonder if "fixer" is just fancy word for hitman. This crew's already been paid to kill some woman--I'm not going to let that happen.</line>
    <line id="219006">This guy crossed a line and he's going to answer for it. He's fresh from a heist. Well, there's still time to stop him before he disappears.</line>
    <line id="219007">They're dealing in human organs. I know how it works. Cut them open, harvest the organs and let them die. I'm going to enjoy taking these guys out.</line>
    <line id="219008">This guy's out of control. If I don't stop him, he's going to hurt a lot of people. Yeah, he's so sure he's going to avoid prison. I'm going to give him a reality check.</line>
    <line id="219009">If the Club hired this guy to make bombs, they're planning to do something nasty soon. I've gotta make sure they never get the chance.</line>
    <line id="219010">This guy's running with a Viceroy initiation crew, which means they're gonna shoot random people just to prove they have the balls to do it. I need to put these assholes down.</line>
    <line id="219011">These extortion rackets have escalated. The people who fight back have been turning up mutilated. Well now I've finally found these guys and I'm going to give it right back to 'em.</line>
    <line id="219012">Seems like anybody with money can make somebody else disappear with the right contacts. Yeah, fixers like this are no different from mob enforcers or street thugs. Just ruthless killers. And that's how I'll deal with 'em.</line>
    <line id="219013">These assholes are preying on illegal immigrants. People that won't be missed by anybody who can do something about it. Well, I'm about to give them a big surprise. I'll throw the ringleader to the cops--let them track this to the source.</line>
    <line id="219014">I intercepted this one too late to stop the murder, but I can make sure it won't happen again.</line>
    <line id="219015">Corrupt cops... they're at the bottom of my barrel. If people can't trust the peacekeepers, where do they turn? May not be the perfect solution, but I'm not letting these guys walk.</line>
    <line id="219016">Normally I'd just let these guys kill each other off, but it sounds like they're going to pick a public venue for their ambush. I am not going to let that happen.</line>
    <line id="219017">Fixers work for the highest bidder, but once a contract is taken, they're going to follow through. I've got a chance to prevent a murder here ... if I can find these guys in time.</line>
    <line id="219019">Usually if the cops get close to somebody, that somebody ends up dead in a gutter before they can talk. Yeah, this guy must be a VIP. I'm gonna leave him as a little gift for the CPD--that'll shake up the Viceroys.</line>

    <line id="219055">We've got so many assholes fighting for scraps, honest people just don't have a chance anymore. Somebody's got to send a message.</line>

    <line id="219060">My first instinct is to put a bullet in this guy's face, but I can do worse. Guys like this, they think they're on top. So I'll pull him off his pedestal, humiliate him in front of his crew. I'll show them I can get to anybody.</line>
    <line id="219061">Decent drug cooks aren't always easy to come by. If the Viceroys are protecting this guy, I can do some major damage here. I'll use him. Send a message to any aspiring kitchen crew.</line>

    <line id="219119">Another hacker. Going to find this guy. Let's see what he's got.</line>
    <line id="219120">Guy seems to have skills. I'm up for the challenge.</line>
    <line id="219121">This hacker's probably prowling for victims. He's about to become one.</line>
    <line id="219122">You put yourself on the grid, you become a target. Let's see if I can find this hacker.</line>
    <line id="219123">Looks like I've got a target. Clearly this guy knows how to hack, but I'm in a different league.</line>
    <line id="219124">This hacker probably thinks nobody's watching. He's in for a surprise.</line>
    <line id="219125">This hacker knows what he's doing, but so do I. I'm going to find him.</line>
    <line id="219126">This hacker could do some real damage. I'm going to track him down.</line>
    <line id="219127">This hacker's sloppy, but effective. It's time to show him how it's done.</line>
    <line id="219128">This hacker's crossing a line. I'm going to find him and teach him a lesson.</line>
    <line id="219129">Careless hacking puts you at risk. This guy's about to find out the hard way.</line>
    <line id="219131">An XP bonus will be awarded for collecting 10 [CSS_BLUE]Audio Logs[CSS_END].</line>
    <line id="219132">Collect 4 Audio Logs to acquire the D-12 shotgun within the Weapon Wheel.</line>

    <line id="219134">MISSION FAILED</line>
    <line id="219135">You failed to hack the target.</line>
    <line id="219137">I better wipe the hard drive. I don't want anyone else tracking Kenney.</line>
    <line id="219138">Yeah, something is not right here. I'm going to see what the Profiler has to say about this one. I need to find him.</line>
    <line id="219139">Ok ... you've got my attention. Let's find out who you are.</line>
    <line id="219140">I want to take a closer look at this one. Looks suspicious to me.</line>
    <line id="219141">Huh. I'm going to tail this one and see what he does.</line>
    <line id="219142">This guy's up to something. I need to get close… see what the Profiler has on him.</line>
    <line id="219143">Looks like a potential target. I want a closer look.</line>
    <line id="219144">I want to run this one through the system, see what comes up. I'll have to move in close.</line>
    <line id="219145">I want to check this one out and make sure he's not up to something.</line>
    <line id="219146">I'm going to shadow this guy; see what he's doing.</line>
    <line id="219147">Alright, what are you up to? I'm going to get close enough to profile.</line>
    <line id="219150">I'm going to follow up on this one. Make sure this guy checks out.</line>
    <line id="219151">Got a hunch this guy could be a problem. I've got to get close enough. Profile him, just to be sure.</line>
    <line id="219152">This contract calls for stealing and decrypting data. Sounds easy enough, but I won't be the only one after it.</line>
    <line id="219153">Just gotta grab the data and decrypt it before anybody else does. No doubt I'm going to come face to face with fixers.</line>
    <line id="219154">The contract's clear - I need to recover data and get it decrypted. But I should expect heavy resistance on the way.</line>
    <line id="219155">Looks like a scramble to steal and decrypt data. This contract's going to attract fixers. They always do.</line>
    <line id="219156">This one could get messy. I'm going to be competing with other fixers to get that data and decrypt it.</line>
    <line id="219157">I've got to find that data first and get it decrypted fast. I'm going to be dealing with fixers, so I can't afford mistakes.</line>
    <line id="219158">I'm being thrown into the ring with a bunch of fixers, so I'm going to have to play this one smart. I need to get in, get the data, and get it decrypted.</line>
    <line id="219159">The contract is for data decryption, but I'm going to have to steal it first. I won't be alone in that goal, so I need to watch my back.</line>
    <line id="219160">This is all about data theft and decryption, but I won't be the only one gunning for it.</line>
    <line id="219161">Everybody's going to be after that data, trying to get it decrypted fast to cash in the contract. I need to be faster.</line>
    <line id="219162">Decrypting the data would be easy enough, but my competition is going to make sure it's anything but easy.</line>
    <line id="219163">This contract's on the table for anybody who wants it, so I can expect heavy competition to steal and decrypt that data.</line>
    <line id="219164">I'm game. Let's go.</line>
    <line id="219165">Okay. I’m up for it.</line>
    <line id="219166">Yeah, I'm ready.</line>
    <line id="219167">You've got it. Let's go.</line>
    <line id="219168">Okay, sure. I'll take you on.</line>
    <line id="219169">Going to give you a run for it...</line>
    <line id="219170">Let's see your moves...</line>
    <line id="219176">I dropped the ball on that contract. Can't let that happen again.</line>
    <line id="219177">I can't just blow a contract like that or I'm going to get a reputation...</line>
    <line id="219178">Damn, what was I thinking? This isn't good for my reputation.</line>
    <line id="219179">Got to pull it together. I can't half-ass things.</line>
    <line id="219180">I fucked that one up, plain and simple.</line>
    <line id="219181">Gotta up my game. If I'm unreliable, nobody's going to want to work with me.</line>
    <line id="219182">I blew it. I need to get my head back in the game.</line>
    <line id="219183">That did not go well. Shit.</line>
    <line id="219184">Damn. I can do better than that.</line>
    <line id="219185">Got too much on my mind. It's affecting my performance.</line>
    <line id="219186">That didn't work out. Gotta try harder.</line>
    <line id="219187">Well, that was a wash. Damn.</line>
    <line id="219188">Made some mistakes there. It won't happen again.</line>
    <line id="219189">Not sure what went wrong there. It happens.</line>
    <line id="219190">The Firepower loadout contains the G106 grenade launcher, the R-33 machine pistol, and IEDs.</line>

    <line id="219194">Came in with a plan and stuck to it.</line>
    <line id="219195">Easier than I expected.</line>
    <line id="219196">I wish they'd all go down like that.</line>
    <line id="219197">And that is how you want these to go.</line>
    <line id="219198">That was easy enough.</line>

    <line id="219254">Get me IT. Maybe one of those guys can find something. </line>

    <line id="219640">The cops are just waiting for somebody to snatch this bike, which means I'm going to be up against the ctOS once I've got it.</line>
    <line id="219641">The truck they want's going to be a bitch to get out of there. It's slow, so it'll probably take some abuse. Good thing it can handle it.</line>
    <line id="219642">Sounds like an easy pick-up, which makes me suspicious. The easy ones tend to go south fast.</line>
    <line id="219643">Gotta move a car without dinging it up too bad. If I stay off the beaten path, things will go a lot easier.</line>
    <line id="219644">Looks like they want a car transported in pristine condition. If I'm smart about my route, I should be able to get it to them without too many scratches.</line>
    <line id="219645">Just a simple transport, only they're worried about dings. If I stick to the side streets and shortcuts, I should be able to deliver it in good shape.</line>
    <line id="219646">Gotta get a car from A to B without smashing it up. Sounds easy enough if I stay off the main roads as much as possible.</line>

    <line id="219669">As usual, ensure there are no traces back to us.</line>
    <line id="219673">Police have made another shocking discovery--a graphic crime scene they have attributed to the "Fingerpaint Killer." The same man has now been linked to three separate murders, all of them victimizing young women. When asked how these women were connected, we were told, quote, "These young ladies all lived high-risk lives where they were easy prey."</line>
    <line id="219674">Today Pawnee police are investigating a murder with a surprising twist. Though we have no official confirmation, our sources tell us the body is believed to be that of the Fingerpaint Killer. We don't yet know what police found on scene to lead to such a conclusion, but stay tuned for updates as we learn more.</line>
    <line id="219675">Edgar Noone is a name that will continue to haunt Chicago and surrounding areas in the years to come. Known to locals as the Fingerpaint Killer, Noone is now believed to have slain a dozen women over the past decade, most of them sex workers. The hunt for answers continues, but journals found in Noone's home spoke of monsters and infected blood. Another unanswered question remains - who killed Edgar Noone?  While social media very vocally declares Noone another victim of the Vigilante, police refuse to speculate.</line>
    <line id="219676">Cops showed up, had to ditch the ammo.</line>
    <line id="219677">Pick it up before somebody snoops...</line>
    <line id="219678">Then we work on the salvage plan.</line>

    <line id="220402">I ALWAYS get the blame.</line>
    <line id="220403">Even when it's his fucking fault.</line>
    <line id="220404">I'm done. I know where he lives.</line>
    <line id="220405">What are you saying?</line>
    <line id="220407">Fed up. I'm going to knife him. </line>
    <line id="220408">Come on, the cops monitor this stuff. </line>
    <line id="220409">No they don't.</line>
    <line id="220410">They do. They totally do.</line>
    <line id="220411">Got my target. </line>
    <line id="220412">What do they want you to do?</line>
    <line id="220413">What do you think they want me to do?</line>
    <line id="220414">You're not gonna kill him, right?</line>
    <line id="220416">Have you ever killed anybody?</line>
    <line id="220417">LOL whut.</line>
    <line id="220418">Serious. I'm thinking about it. </line>
    <line id="220419">Maybe today. </line>
    <line id="220420">I think this is the guy she's seeing. </line>
    <line id="220421">Going to teach him a lesson. </line>
    <line id="220422">You THINK? What if it's not him?</line>
    <line id="220423">He fits the description. It's him.</line>
    <line id="220425">I want to stab somebody. </line>
    <line id="220426">Say that again?</line>
    <line id="220427">I want to stab somebody. Just to see what it feels like. </line>
    <line id="220428">You're such a goon.</line>
    <line id="220429">We can ruin her. I'll help. </line>
    <line id="220430">I have all the evidence.</line>
    <line id="220431">She'll come out clean. She always does!</line>
    <line id="220432">No. I'm going to finish this. </line>
    <line id="220434">Calm down. What are you going to do?</line>
    <line id="220435">Squeeze the life out of her.</line>
    <line id="220436">That's fucking what.</line>
    <line id="220437">:( Come on. Don't talk like that.</line>
    <line id="220439">Did you hurt her?</line>
    <line id="220440">Not yet.</line>
    <line id="220441">What do you mean yet? Leave her alone. </line>
    <line id="220442">Are you on her side now?</line>
    <line id="220444">Are you sure it was her?</line>
    <line id="220445">Absolutely. It was her.</line>
    <line id="220446">Not the first time, either. </line>
    <line id="220447">I'm going to make her regret it. </line>
    <line id="220449">I hate her so much. </line>
    <line id="220450">Why does she get you so worked up?</line>
    <line id="220451">I don't know!! </line>
    <line id="220452">I'm going to go find out.</line>
    <line id="220454">I dreamed about her again last night. </line>
    <line id="220455">Just put my hands around her throat.</line>
    <line id="220456">And just squeezed.</line>
    <line id="220457">You scare me. </line>
    <line id="220618">Don't worry about it. Just a fight.</line>
    <line id="220619">A fair one?</line>
    <line id="220620">Course not. We're sending a message.</line>
    <line id="220621">He won't fuck with us again. </line>
    <line id="220623">Damien can make all the demands he wants. I don't trust him. I'm not handing over anything until I know what we have. Then I'll deal with Damien.</line>
    <line id="220624">Gonna fuck the dude up. </line>
    <line id="220625">So they just point and you attack?</line>
    <line id="220626">Yup. :)</line>
    <line id="220627">Your mom would be real proud.</line>
    <line id="220629">What did this guy do?</line>
    <line id="220630">Dunno. Pissed off the V's. </line>
    <line id="220631">That's all it takes.</line>
    <line id="220632">If he lives, he won't do it again.</line>
    <line id="220633">Asshole's been snooping.</line>
    <line id="220634">So we got the call to beat him down. </line>
    <line id="220635">Are you going to help?</line>
    <line id="220636">They make the call, you go. </line>
    <line id="220638">You're still mixed up in that shit?</line>
    <line id="220639">Ya.</line>
    <line id="220640">Gotta work some punk today. </line>
    <line id="220641">He been running his mouth. </line>
    <line id="220642">Need an alibi. </line>
    <line id="220643">Gonna beat some dude down.</line>
    <line id="220644">Viceroy orders.</line>
    <line id="220645">I'm not covering for you again. </line>
    <line id="220647">Just a warning. Stay away from him today.</line>
    <line id="220648">Club's got his name.</line>
    <line id="220649">You don't want to be close when they find him. </line>
    <line id="220652">This guy knows something. </line>
    <line id="220653">We're going to work him over.</line>
    <line id="220654">What does he know?</line>
    <line id="220655">Ask me tomorrow. :)</line>
    <line id="220657">Come on, he's harmless.</line>
    <line id="220658">That's what he wants you to think. </line>
    <line id="220659">But we're going to hurt him. </line>
    <line id="220662">Guy got plenty of warnings and didn't stop. </line>
    <line id="220663">Just give him one more. Please.</line>
    <line id="220664">Too late. This is for his own good. </line>
    <line id="220665">Next time they'll just gun him down. </line>
    <line id="220667">I'm stoked. Been waiting for the call on this guy. </line>
    <line id="220668">Always wanted to get a couple of kicks in on him. </line>
    <line id="220669">Remind me never to piss you off. </line>
    <line id="220672">Yeah I was afraid of this. He's the target. </line>
    <line id="220673">So you're going to have to call it off.</line>
    <line id="220674">What? There's no calling it off. You know that. </line>
    <line id="220675">Just going to rearrange his face a little. </line>
    <line id="220677">I want to burn something. </line>
    <line id="220678">Something like...</line>
    <line id="220679">I don't know yet. Something big. </line>
    <line id="220680">I want to make a mark. </line>
    <line id="220682">I'm not so unusual.</line>
    <line id="220683">I read a lot of people like fire.</line>
    <line id="220684">I don't care if you like fire, just keep it safe.</line>
    <line id="220685">Where's the fun in that?</line>
    <line id="220688">I better restock my weapons. Everyone's out to kill me now.</line>
    <line id="220775">I'm on DedSec's side here. I want to make some noise.</line>
    <line id="220776">You're not even a hacker.</line>
    <line id="220777">No, but I can make some noise. </line>
    <line id="220778">I can burn it down. </line>
    <line id="220780">Be honest with me, are you setting those fires?</line>
    <line id="220781">No. </line>
    <line id="220782">I don't believe you. </line>
    <line id="220783">I don't care if you believe me. </line>
    <line id="220785">Going to burn it down. </line>
    <line id="220786">All of it. </line>
    <line id="220787">LOL. </line>
    <line id="220788">I'm serious. </line>
    <line id="220790">He told me you were thinking about starting another fire. </line>
    <line id="220791">WTF. He can't share what's said in a session. </line>
    <line id="220792">Maybe I'll  burn his house. </line>
    <line id="220793">Don't make stupid threats. He's only trying to help. </line>
    <line id="220795">You need to face him like a man. </line>
    <line id="220796">He deserves that. </line>
    <line id="220797">Yeah. Sure. </line>
    <line id="220798">I'm serious. Don't be a coward.</line>
    <line id="220800">Just one shot and it's done.</line>
    <line id="220801">Don't be a fucking fool. </line>
    <line id="220802">One shot and your life is over.</line>
    <line id="220803">Nah. V's got my back. </line>
    <line id="220805">Got the KC on him. </line>
    <line id="220806">KC?</line>
    <line id="220807">Kill Command. :)</line>
    <line id="220808">You're not going to do it. Right?</line>
    <line id="220810">They're going to torture him. </line>
    <line id="220811">So do something about it. </line>
    <line id="220812">I can't go against the Viceroys. Come on!</line>
    <line id="220813">I'll make it quick for him. Won't see it coming. </line>
    <line id="220815">Motherfucker ignored our warning. </line>
    <line id="220816">Iraq won't take that shit.</line>
    <line id="220817">Don't be a part of this. </line>
    <line id="220818">I AM a part of this. I got the call. </line>
    <line id="220820">Stay away from him.</line>
    <line id="220821">He's a target now. </line>
    <line id="220822">What? Why?</line>
    <line id="220823">None of your biz.</line>
    <line id="220824">I'm going to have to leave town for a while. </line>
    <line id="220825">What? Why?</line>
    <line id="220826">Gotta do a hit and disappear. </line>
    <line id="220827">What do you mean "a hit?"</line>
    <line id="220828">I need to borrow some cash.</line>
    <line id="220829">What for?</line>
    <line id="220830">The Club wants me to pop somebody. </line>
    <line id="220831">And I need a bus ticket out.</line>
    <line id="220833">This is my big break...</line>
    <line id="220834">I just wish it was something easy. </line>
    <line id="220835">They gave me a name and a gun. </line>
    <line id="220836">Jesus. Don't send me shit like this. </line>
    <line id="220837">This guy sold us out.</line>
    <line id="220838">So he's done. </line>
    <line id="220839">I thought you stopped doing these jobs.</line>
    <line id="220840">I did. But I can't say no. </line>
    <line id="220842">So they told me where this guy's gonna be. </line>
    <line id="220843">And I have my orders, but I don't have an escape plan. </line>
    <line id="220844">This isn't something you escape.</line>
    <line id="220845">The cops WILL trace it to you eventually.</line>
    <line id="220846">They want him gone, I'll make him gone. </line>
    <line id="220847">I'm a man of my word.</line>
    <line id="220848">Really? You promised you were done with this.</line>
    <line id="220849">I'm a man of my word when cash is involved.</line>
    <line id="220851">Yo, my mark's moving.</line>
    <line id="220852">Can you help me find him?</line>
    <line id="220853">I'm not helping you.</line>
    <line id="220854">Fine. I'll do it myself! </line>
    <line id="220855">Can I swing by later?</line>
    <line id="220856">Not today. I got a job to do. </line>
    <line id="220857">Going to have to lay low for a few days. </line>
    <line id="220858">Guy shot at us. </line>
    <line id="220859">Almost took off my damn head. </line>
    <line id="220860">So I'm going to pay him back. U in?</line>

    <line id="220862">You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.</line>
    <line id="220863">And you're the horns?</line>
    <line id="220864">Damn straight. This motherfucker's dead.</line>
    <line id="220865">Done taking lip from him. </line>
    <line id="220866">Going to take him out. </line>
    <line id="220867">You're making a mistake. </line>
    <line id="220868">No. He made the misake. </line>
    <line id="220869">Don't try to warn him. I'll know it was you. </line>
    <line id="220870">Are you threatening me, too?</line>
    <line id="220871">I'm just saying. He's going to die. You don't have to.</line>
    <line id="220872">Just a quick hit an they let me out. </line>
    <line id="220873">Do you really believe them?</line>
    <line id="220874">You pull that trigger and they own you.</line>
    <line id="220875">I gotta trust them.</line>
    <line id="220877">You're running with dangerous people.</line>
    <line id="220878">I AM dangerous people. </line>
    <line id="220879">Yeah, right. LOL.</line>
    <line id="220880">Somebody's going to die tonight. </line>
    <line id="220882">I know he's an asshole, but you can't kill him. </line>
    <line id="220883">He didn't mean anything by it.</line>
    <line id="220884">I won't tolerate disrespect.</line>
    <line id="220885">I let him get away with it, others will do the same. </line>
    <line id="220887">Nobody's going to miss this guy. </line>
    <line id="220888">It's a miracle nobody's taken him out already. </line>
    <line id="220889">You shouldn't be the one to do it. </line>
    <line id="220890">This is going to bite you in the ass. </line>
    <line id="220892">You should call it off. Not worth it. </line>
    <line id="220893">I got orders.</line>
    <line id="220894">Besides, he'd end up fucking you over too. </line>
    <line id="220895">This is for the best. I'll kill him fast. </line>
    <line id="220897">You're really doing this?</line>
    <line id="220898">I'm really doing this. </line>
    <line id="220899">Why? You're not a killer. </line>
    <line id="220900">The less I say the better. </line>
    <line id="220902">I'm ready to go. </line>
    <line id="220903">Where?</line>
    <line id="220904">The hit. Damn, pay attention. </line>
    <line id="220905">Oh shit. Sorry. Wrong contact.</line>
    <line id="220907">Can't make it, got business.</line>
    <line id="220908">Business? You?</line>
    <line id="220909">Viceroy business. You don't want to know.</line>
    <line id="220910">You're right. I don't. </line>
    <line id="220912">I just walk up, pop pop. Done. </line>
    <line id="220913">And then what?</line>
    <line id="220914">Shit, the V's will cover for me. </line>
    <line id="220917">They think we can't touch them. </line>
    <line id="220918">But ain't nobody safe from the Viceroys. </line>
    <line id="220919">You're going to start a war. </line>
    <line id="220920">So? We're ready for one. </line>
    <line id="220922">If this guy lives, I'm in big trouble. </line>
    <line id="220923">He saw everything. </line>
    <line id="220924">Just turn yourself in. You'll get a year max. </line>
    <line id="220925">Nah. Got an easier way.</line>
    <line id="220927">Fucker steps up, we put him down. </line>
    <line id="220928">We warned him. </line>
    <line id="220929">He's full of shit. He won't do anything. </line>
    <line id="220930">Maybe not. But we will. </line>
    <line id="220932">Tell them to stay in their apartment. </line>
    <line id="220933">There will be shots.</line>
    <line id="220934">Why will there be shots??</line>
    <line id="220935">You don't need to know that.</line>
    <line id="220937">They handed me a bag with a gun in it. </line>
    <line id="220938">There's a name written on the bag.</line>
    <line id="220939">Why are you telling me this?</line>
    <line id="220940">Just in case I vanish. So you know why. </line>
    <line id="220941">If I do it fast and get out, I get paid. </line>
    <line id="220942">What is "it?"</line>
    <line id="220943">Putting down a stray dog.</line>
    <line id="220944">You'd better be joking. I will call the police.</line>
    <line id="220946">It's him or me. </line>
    <line id="220947">So it's going to be him. </line>
    <line id="220948">Or you could just leave town. </line>
    <line id="220949">I don't run. </line>
    <line id="220950">Why? Why do this?</line>
    <line id="220951">Dude shot one of us. His turn. </line>
    <line id="220952">And then his guys shoot another one of you.</line>
    <line id="220953">Yup. That's how it plays out.</line>
    <line id="220955">This one's a special target. </line>
    <line id="220956">A personal favor. </line>
    <line id="220957">A favor for who??</line>
    <line id="220958">Can't tell you. But you don't say no. </line>
    <line id="220959">He doesn't get another chance. He's dead.</line>
    <line id="220960">Don't get involved in it. </line>
    <line id="220961">My name came up. It's on me. </line>
    <line id="220962">You going to try to talk me out of it?</line>
    <line id="220963">Should I? </line>
    <line id="220964">No. It won't work. </line>

    <line id="220966">Guy ran off with our money. </line>
    <line id="220967">Says he spent it all. Only one answer to that. </line>
    <line id="220968">This is all so stupid. Grow up. </line>
    <line id="220969">I've gotta take him out. </line>
    <line id="220970">If I don't, they may target you.</line>
    <line id="220971">So you're saying it's him or me??</line>
    <line id="220972">Exactly. I always watch out for you.</line>
    <line id="220973">I know how this works. I've done it before.</line>
    <line id="220974">Just trust me. It'll be fine. </line>
    <line id="220975">You're going to get yourself killed!</line>
    <line id="220976">Does he deserve it?</line>
    <line id="220977">Yes. No. I dunno?</line>

    <line id="223136">[Silence 3]Do you ever find yourself staring out the window wondering why 2.7 million people scurry from point A to point B, never even realizing that there is a point C? People no longer seek information because they're filled to capacity. Overloaded. Take a look around out there. Look at all the billboards and the monitors. How much Blume do you see?  Do you think there will be more or less when the next  ctOS goes live? Keep looking for point C and we'll keep talking.</line>
    <line id="223138">Did you vote this year? If the answer is "no," change that answer to "yes," because a vote and a non-vote are exactly the same. Every one of you voted for the same candidate because they all work for the same system. That system has not changed in the past fifty years. Whether you want to wait in a line to stamp "I participated" on a piece of paper or you want to ignore the whole process, the system continues unfazed and uncaring. But it is NOT unstoppable. To do it -- you're going to have to do more than just choose a name. DedSec can help.</line>
    <line id="223140">Everything that makes your life easier consists of the same basic materials. The planet will soon run out of these materials. We've already exhausted over half our supply in the last 100 years and production is only increasing. Governments are already waging wars, overt and shadow, to control those final building blocks, but who will end up with the most toys? Who really funds those wars? Who is on the receiving end of every favor owed? The answer is easy. Take your phone out of your pocket and look at the logo.</line>
    <line id="223142">[Silence 3]We loved your new profile pic. That's a great haircut. Congratulations on the new job. A 25% raise? Fantastic. You deserved that widescreen TV. We just saw your status change, we're so happy you found your soulmate. Your kid is growing up so fast, she walks to school all by herself. That intersection in the picture behind her, we know that place. It's a safe neighborhood. You don't even need to lock your door. [Silence 2]Wake up. Stop authoring your own tragedy.</line>
    <line id="223144">[Silence 3]Why do WE hide behind our masks? Why do they hide behind their masks? Drop their corporate lawyers and government connections and we'll drop our hoods. They point at DedSec, label us the boogeyman while they root through your closet. We're not asking you to be friends. We're asking you to turn on the flashlight. Take a look under the bed. Because monsters are real and you're looking in the wrong place.</line>
    <line id="223146">You want to make a statement. You want to be a part of the change. But I don't know how, you say. I am powerless. I am weak. I am afraid. We answer: one person can disrupt an entire system simply by standing still. One person can spread a message to a thousand more simply by choosing to speak. Stand beside others, and you become a wall. Shout along with others, and you become a bullhorn. If we push together, we can topple their towers.</line>
    <line id="223148">We can see you. There are currently three different cameras recording you. One of them is recording for the Chicago Police department. One of them feeds directly into Blume through the ctOS. The other one, we're not even sure where it goes. You can try to avoid them, but there are over twenty thousand more in Chicago alone. Your privacy is gone.</line>
    <line id="223150">How long would it take to subvert the entire ctOS? To shut down every camera, monitoring system, emergency response, transit, commerce, and communication. How long to cripple this entire "safe" city? It would take us a mere thirty seconds. Now imagine if we were to rise up as civilians, to challenge the powers that be. How long would it take them to shut us down when they control the power switch? Your tax dollars have paid for your own muzzle and cage.</line>

- To perform a takedown, you must sneak up behind them; you cannot attack from the front.</line>

    <line id="227680">Listen--they were talking about a mole. If we find him and get him out, he can probably tell us who runs this operation and where to find 'em. You can be mad at me later.</line>
    <line id="227687">I want a peek inside that boat. Our mole may be in there.</line>
    <line id="227691">Can he sit up? Fuck it, just hold him up. This is session #3 with Alex Javorski, who is not the name he gave us. Alex here is an undercover cop.</line>
    <line id="227692">I- I'm not a cop! I'm- I'm just an informant, okay? Look, they barely even pay me anything. Listen, listen--you let me go, and I'll leave the country. You got my word.</line>
    <line id="227693">I want everything you photographed, sent, or stored and a list of your contacts. Or my buddy here's going to stab you.</line>
    <line id="227694">No way, no way. I give you that and you'll kill me, right? No!</line>
    <line id="227695">I bet the guy they whisked away is our mole. Still following them?</line>
    <line id="227696">Follow them ... how?</line>
    <line id="227701">Head's starting to clear up, but my guts feel like they're about to abandon ship. Let's hope tailing my little Blume buddy paid off. I think I might have struck gold here. Jesus. If I can just keep my lunch down. Okay, T... Don't give in.</line>
    <line id="227741">Damn, that'd take me days to track him through this. No time--let's see if I can get his goat, though ... make him slip up. Hopefully he's paying attention.</line>
    <line id="227742">Really slumming it here, ain't ya? I was expecting something a little more dramatic. I'm a little disappointed.</line>

    <line id="227758">I see you down there, Frewer. I can open your door from here. Stay low.</line>
    <line id="227760">I'm gonna go out on a leash here and say those lights are bad news.</line>

Enemy damage is reduced, detection is permissive, and chases are easier. For players who want to have a smoother WATCH_DOGS™ experience.

Medium
The WATCH_DOGS™ experience as intended.

Hard
Enemy damage is increased and it's harder to recover from mistakes. Chasers are more aggressive. For those who want more of a challenge out of WATCH_DOGS™.

Realistic
Enemies deal massive damage, and are more reactive during stealth. Chasers are relentless, and every mistake is costly. For those who want to be Aiden Pearce.</line>

    <line id="10000298">Officially, you've got a spotless record. In 2009, you were following a suspect in the Parker Square stranglings. You requested a search warrant, but they wouldn't give you one.</line>
    <line id="10000299">Who is this?</line>
    <line id="10000300">They wouldn't give you one because *they* were corrupt. So you went into his house anyway. Found what you wanted. Planted it where you needed to plant it.</line>

    <line id="10000316">Sometimes I imagine Nicky and Jackson getting ready for the new day. Maybe they've moved somewhere out in the prairies. They've got a house twice as big as their little place in Chicago. They've got an endless backyard, filled with Jackson's toys... his new friends. A normal kid again--loud, full of energy. This whole nightmare is behind him, one of those painful things that becomes dull once you've gained some distance from it. Everything moves slower for them, now. They don't even use the internet ... they know better than that. They've changed their names, that's OK -- that helps to dull things, too. Maybe they've forgiven me. I like to think so. Then I see it. Black vans pulling up outside their place. A helicopter flying low. A threatening phone call. It gets my heart racing again. Tempts me to run just one more search. Make a connection. Caus' I know I could find them. But I won't. I can't do that do them again.</line>
    <line id="10000318">I've dealt with enough "Fixers" lately, I'm not even sure what the term means anymore. Maybe I'm old-school, but Jordi Chin always fit my definition: efficient, deadly, and most importantly ... for sale. Whenever I got stuck in a mess, Jordi was the first person I called and the only person I had to call because Fixers get it done. I guess Jordi's old-school too, because this new breed of Fixer has a different way of working. I doubt they could stand toe to toe with Jordi in a gunfight, but they've got something he doesn't - they can hack. They exploit the ctOS. They're networked--they know how to track a digital shadow and coordinate an attack. These guys are fully-adapted modern criminals with a wide range of skills and eventually I'm going to run into one who is better than me. I need to be ready for that.</line>
    <line id="10000320">Now I never was a religious man, but I did have an idea once to put karma, religion, superstition... et cetera... to a test. Crowdsource it. Kind of like that old theory that you could coordinate everybody on one one side of the planet to jump at the same time and knock us right the fuck out of orbit. My idea, though--you get everybody to make the same wish, thought, prayer, pointed in the same direction all at once. What happens when a single, collective voice demands a miracle? Maybe nothing? That led me into another thought. What if... bullshit or not... you're the one running this site? You could cheat the vote. You've suddenly got a mass of people all thinking the same thing you've programmed them to think and you're pointing them right at your target. All they need is one "miracle" and you've got them hooked. What are you going to do to make sure that miracle happens? That's when I started to come down from the LSD and realized that the idea sounded a lot better when I was high.</line>

    <line id="10000326">If you ever want a good snapshot of the current state of human spiritual evolution--how close we are to actually figuring shit out--you don't have to look any further than the internet. It's a place where you can find 500 page fan-fiction about anthromorphic 80s cartoon characters romancing androgynous pop idols. Where you can find forum flame wars between people who fantasize about being eaten by giants and people who find tiny robot animals erotic. You can sell your own bottled urine or buy somebody else's toenail clippings. Don't even get me started on what girls and cups are doing these days. Uh uh. Makes you want to unplug the whole damn thing, sometimes, don't it? Well, maybe after I finish my fan-fiction.</line>
    <line id="10000327">If you roll your socks into balls to keep them matched--here's a trick: buy all your socks in the same damn color. Problem solved. Fuck your sock-balls and fuck you.</line>
    <line id="10000328">There are two kinds of people in the world, assholes and people who don't label people. Hell, most of them are assholes too.</line>
    <line id="10000329">Hi, I'm a talking moose who was probably made in a third-world sweatshop by malnourished children. Ain't I fuckin' funny. Ha ha.</line>
    <line id="10000330">If you're going to be the one who dies with the most toys, at least be the one who made them.</line>
    <line id="10000331">Ain't nothing in life for free unless you're willing to grab it and run like a motherfucker.</line>
    <line id="10000333">So I made the mistake of running my name through the search engines today. Been a while since I did that and now I remember why. People still got a hate hard-on for me. Even found a few bullshit sightings around the country, like I'm Bigfoot or something actually worth hunting. My message got through, at least--my story's being used as a security lesson, but I don't like being the bogeyman in their example. I mean, I had reasons for what I did and Blume knew it. That ugly mug in the old broadcasts that keeps popping up - I don't even recognize him anymore. That ain't me - those were dark times. Angry times. And now I'm just tired. I been in the trenches too long, people. I've earned my R&amp;R.</line>
    <line id="10000335">So Blume's been looking at investing into our hackerspace and that's got everybody at each other's throats. Some of us want to avoid the corporate control--kind of goes against the spirit of what we do here, right? But on the other hand, we're talking about BIG money and that means the projects get bigger. We could do something real here instead of just playing around. Blume's promising they won't take away any of our creative control. They say they want to invest, not dictate. Do I trust them? Not entirely. Is the risk worth the the reward? Yes. But I'm in the minority here. These guys would rather discuss starship engineering than our future here. I'm going to have to convince them. Also: Why do people fixate on the aesthetics of a starship? There's no need to be sleek in space. Functionality is key, not... not form.</line>
    <line id="10000337">The lab's all worked up over the Blume branding we got. BlumeForge. Sounds fine to me. Pete quit - said he wasn't willing to sell his soul to the dark gods for financial gain. He pointed right at me because somehow I've now become the unofficial liaison between us. Thing is -- I'm not in this for the money. I know, I know. that's what everybody says. But really--I'm eager to see what we can do. I feel like I've finally been given a shot at something. No more computer repairs and tech support, these guys are giving me a shot to prove myself and I'm going to take it. I've decided to tell Sandy tonight. Can't wait to see her face. She's been working two jobs to support us this year, and I know she's been wanting to give the middle finger to her own dark gods and walk like Pete did.</line>
    <line id="10000339">They moved Rose and I into a proper Blume lab this week and we were introduced to our new project. They're calling it the Central Operating System - ctOS for short. Software to run an entire city. I knew we were going big, but this is ... BIG. We'll be working on a test site, we're calling it the Bunker. I met one of my new partners today. Everybody went quiet when he walked in - he's a hacking legend. Best of the best, they say. Looked like a knuckle-dragger to me. Right away, he started picking on me. Said my parents were, and I quote, "a pair of dirty douchebags" for naming me Tobias and that he's going to call me Frewer from now on. Nobody's called me Frewer since gym class back in high school. I'm not going to let this hooligan ruin a good thing for me.</line>
    <line id="10000340">Gotta connect to ctOS first.</line>
    <line id="10000341">No good unless I connect to ctOS.</line>
    <line id="10000342">I'm not connected to the local ctOS grid, double plus un-good.</line>
    <line id="10000343">I need ctOS access first.</line>
    <line id="10000344">I can't do it without ctOS network access.</line>
    <line id="10000345">Damn. You're good.</line>
    <line id="10000346">How did you…</line>
    <line id="10000347">I underestimated you.</line>
    <line id="10000348">Smooth moves, man.</line>
    <line id="10000349">Wait a minute. How did you...</line>
    <line id="10000350">How the hell?</line>
    <line id="10000351">I been sharked.</line>
    <line id="10000353">Damn.</line>
    <line id="10000355">Well ... shit.</line>

    <line id="10000377">Easy-peasy.</line>
    <line id="10000378">Got it.</line>
    <line id="10000379">Take that!</line>
    <line id="10000380">Gotcha.</line>
    <line id="10000381">You got anything harder?</line>
    <line id="10000383">Watch out--it's armed!</line>
    <line id="10000385">It's armed!</line>
    <line id="10000387">Shit, it's hot.</line>
    <line id="10000389">Watch yourselves, amigos, it's armed!</line>
    <line id="10000391">Heads up--it's armed.</line>
    <line id="10000402">This way.</line>
    <line id="10000403">Follow me.</line>
    <line id="10000404">Let's go.</line>
    <line id="10000405">Come here.</line>
    <line id="10000406">Let's move.</line>
    <line id="10000408">Uh-uh.</line>
    <line id="10000409">On second thought...</line>
    <line id="10000410">Now's not the time.</line>
    <line id="10000411">Well, that's a bad idea.</line>
    <line id="10000412">Ain't gonna work.</line>
    <line id="10000430">Wait.</line>
    <line id="10000431">Hang on.</line>
    <line id="10000432">Hold it.</line>
    <line id="10000433">Wait there a sec.</line>
    <line id="10000434">Don't move until I say.</line>
    <line id="10000435">Ok, wait.</line>
    <line id="10000436">Stop. Wait for my go.</line>
    <line id="10000437">Don't move.</line>
    <line id="10000439">Let's go, let's go, let's go.</line>
    <line id="10000440">Come on...</line>
    <line id="10000441">Come on, come on...</line>

    <line id="10000443">Ain't got all day...</line>
    <line id="10000455">I had enough.</line>
    <line id="10000456">I'm out.</line>
    <line id="10000457">Nope.</line>
    <line id="10000458">That's it. Estoy finito.</line>
    <line id="10000470">Checkmate.</line>
    <line id="10000471">Gotcha. Checkmate.</line>
    <line id="10000472">Sorry, amigo. That is check and mate.</line>
    <line id="10000473">Looks like the crow has sung. Checkmate.</line>
    <line id="10000474">And that… is checkmate.</line>
    <line id="10000476">Last one…</line>
    <line id="10000477">Here's the River.</line>
    <line id="10000479">Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, come on!</line>

    <line id="10000483">You're slowing down there...</line>
    <line id="10000484">That's all she wrote...</line>
    <line id="10000485">Well, thanking you, mis amigos.</line>
    <line id="10000486">Ain't she purty?</line>
    <line id="10000487">Read 'em and weep.</line>

    <line id="10000524">I been around a while, son…</line>
    <line id="10000525">I saw what you did there.</line>
    <line id="10000526">Bet you weren't expecting that.</line>
    <line id="10000527">Not good enough, my friend.</line>
    <line id="10000528">Easy money.</line>

    <line id="10000618">What's going on here?</line>
    <line id="10000619">What's this supposed to mean?</line>
    <line id="10000653">Stay low!</line>
    <line id="10000654">Keep down.</line>

    <line id="10001324">Hello, my name is Charlotte Gardner, speaking on behalf of Blume. As you know, crime rates have plummeted since Blume brought the ctOS to Chicago. Our system prioritizes security and safety. Last year, Aiden Pearce launched a terrorist attack on the ctOS, but was ultimately unable to bypass our security measures. With the cooperation of the CPD, Blume is now offering a $100,000 reward for any information leading to Aiden Pearce. Thank you for your time and your help to make Chicago a safer city.</line>
    <line id="10001326">Safety and security my ass. Blume wants to enlist the public in their war. This puts a lot of heat on Pearce, and if they lock onto his trail, they'll find mine. Gotta keep an ear to the ground and see if I can keep this under control.</line>
    <line id="10001330">Aw, fuck, no…</line>
    <line id="10001332">It's not Aiden. Jesus. What is this?</line>
    <line id="10001334">Pearce wouldn't run. I know it. So where is he? This city is going to hell. People are dying in the fucking street. Where. Is. He? Fuck. He has to be dead. I--I finished my costume. I didn't have a lot to work with--only blurry news photos. But I think it's close. I haven't gone outside with it yet, but ... maybe it's finally time. Somebody's got to step up, right? Somebody's got to be the Fox.</line>
    <line id="10001335">Fool kid got himself killed playing dress-up. God dammit. Probably shot him before even realizing. Blume's got everybody gunning for Pearce. This is on them.</line>
    <line id="10001336">Looks like somebody's been shopping the Deep Web here. Whoa, this is some scary shit ... crowdfunded assaults. Kill contracts. Here we go...</line>
    <line id="10001338">Yo, Blume put up big money to make Pearce gone. They don't care how we do it, so don't bring the van. We don't need him alive. See if you can get me the Rosarios.</line>
    <line id="10001339">Are you fucking kidding me? Did you hear about the mess they made in Pawnee?</line>
    <line id="10001340">You gotta understand the way the Rosarios think--they don't think. They don't recover data. They don't send a warning. If you fire this bullet, you mean it, because these guys are a motherfucking head shot every time. We get them a description and an address - they'll get it done. Just make sure you get away from ground zero when they show up.</line>
    <line id="10001343">Hello. What are you hiding?</line>
    <line id="10001345">Got an address?</line>
    <line id="10001346">Waiting on Blume. We move as soon as we hear back.</line>
    <line id="10001348">Sounds like they haven't found him yet. That's good news, at least. I should warn him.</line>
    <line id="10001350">Huh. Not answering.</line>
    <line id="10001351">This is an unlisted number. How did you find me?</line>
    <line id="10001352">No such thing as an unlisted number if you search the right lists. I know where Aiden Pearce has been staying. But I want 10k up front or I walk. I've sent you an anonymous account number where you can drop it.</line>
    <line id="10001353">Hold on--how can I be sure you've got information worth 10k?</line>
    <line id="10001354">Nice talking to you. Goodbye.</line>
    <line id="10001355">Wait! Ok, shit. Here. You'd better have something good or I'll mark it stolen.</line>
    <line id="10001356">Oh, it's good. Pearce was living right inside your own house. Some of your employees liked to call it the Bunker.</line>
    <line id="10001357">The Bunker ... of course!</line>
    <line id="10001358">Be sure to send over the rest of the payment when you see I'm right. Trust me, I can be a real pain in the ass when somebody cheats me.</line>
    <line id="10001361">Shame on you. I'll put this to better use.</line>
    <line id="10001364">Dammit. I hope Pearce burned his trail. I'd better get over there and make sure.</line>
    <line id="10001365">Here. I got something. Hotel reservations under an alias. He's in St. Louis.</line>
    <line id="10001368">...and now to unplug this little party.</line>
    <line id="10001370">What just happened?</line>
    <line id="10001371">Wasn't us! How the fuck do we get out of here without power to the lift?</line>
    <line id="10001372">Doesn't either one of you have a flashlight?! Damnit. DAMNIT!</line>
    <line id="10001374">At least if she calls anyone, I'll be the first to know.</line>
    <line id="10001377">St. Louis? Shit. We missed him. Keep digging. I want everything you can find on him. And Ray Kenney ... I bet he was living here, too.</line>
    <line id="10001378">Gotta put a stop to this...</line>
    <line id="10001379">The more I dig into Badboy's files, the more insane this whole thing becomes. First off. Not a dude. Nope. Pretty hot, too. I've seen her picture. That DedSec member that got shot on the news ... Clara Lisle ... that was Badboy. If you're wondering why she got shot, I've got two words for you. Aiden Pearce. Yup, she was hanging out with the Vigilante. But it gets worse. Where did they choose to take their honeymoon? The Bunker. According to Badboy, it's real and she was even inside. So now I find myself in a very frustrating situation. I could hand my discovery over to DedSec and gain a metric fuck-ton of street cred ... or I could cash in for Blume's $100k. I used to be all about fight the man and fuck the system ... or was it the other way around? Anyway, now I'm starting to think the world is in a perpetual downward spiral no matter what we do and I sure could use a new car. What to do, what to do...</line>
    <line id="10001382">Uh oh. Charlotte's making a call.</line>
    <line id="10001383">My contact told me you were working on the Pearce contract. Is this Rosario?</line>
    <line id="10001384">One of them. What do you want?</line>
    <line id="10001385">I have a potential address in St. Louis. Can you make the trip?</line>
    <line id="10001386">I have a fucking car. I can make the fucking trip. Is your money good?</line>
    <line id="10001387">I'm with Blume.</line>
    <line id="10001388">My brothers and I... we will get your fucking man. We've got some targets to hit first, just to be thorough. One of Pearce's old hideouts. Got his sister's address and Doctor Mendez.</line>
    <line id="10001389">I don't need to know the details.</line>
    <line id="10001392">I need to decommission these Bounty Hunters before they can do any damage. Gotta get a warning to Aiden.</line>
    <line id="10001394">Come on brother, you ain't making this easy for me!</line>
    <line id="10001396">T-Bone, you were trying to call?</line>
    <line id="10001397">Oh, NOW you answer the damn phone.</line>
    <line id="10001398">I was in the middle of something ... tricky. I couldn't answer.</line>
    <line id="10001399">Yeah, well I've just stopped some angry motherfuckers ... bounty hunters .... from heading right to your goddamn doorstep. You're welcome. Oh and DedSec knows about you and Clara. And they found the Bunker. By the way, stay away from the Bunker. Charlotte fucking Gardner and Blume live there now.</line>
    <line id="10001400">Okay.</line>
    <line id="10001401">Yeah. You have yourself a nice day.</line>

    <line id="10001411">First, I'll just slip a bug into her phone...
</line>
    <line id="10001412">Sounds like DedSec's sent out a news broadcast. Let's see what these punks are up to...</line>
    <line id="10001413">We are DedSec. Know that an attack on one of us is an attack on us all. We will retaliate. Consider this your last warning. Back off now or prepare for a new kind of war.</line>
    <line id="10001414">That was a pretty direct threat for DedSec's public channel. Usually they like to get all poetic and wordy to try to hook new fish. Something's got them spooked. You don't want to back these guys into a corner--who knows what kind of damage they can do. I'll have to keep one eye open.</line>
    <line id="10001417">DedSec must reboot. It is a shackled army ready to fight. It is the voice of the people, muzzled by its own leaders. That's right. DedSec has leaders, despite their denial. But they would rather stroke their own egos through social media than bring about social change. So blood must be drawn. Every war begins with a tragedy...</line>
    <line id="10001420">Somebody's got their panties in a tangle. Aiden told me about the DedSec's leaders, the "Daves." This whackjob sounds like he's gunning for them.</line>
    <line id="10001423">This guy's DedSec. I'm gonna eavesdrop...</line>
    <line id="10001431">The "Daves." This guy's part of DedSec's inner circle. I don't know what I'll find at the Ambrose, but I have a nasty hunch. I left a tracker on his phone so I can keep tabs on him.</line>
    <line id="10001434">Heck, I'd bet my bottom buck these are two of DedSec's "Daves." These guys are a pain in the ass, sure, but why kill them? The Ambrose was Defalt's old haunt... I doubt that's a coincidence.</line>
    <line id="10001436">One of the Daves sent this out to the others. High priority. Let's take a look...</line>
    <line id="10001438">You need to calm down. I cashed in all my favors to get them here. Don't blow this.</line>
    <line id="10001439">You know I deserve this, I--</line>
    <line id="10001441">Badboy runs a big risk here. She told us all about you. Enough for us to come to a decision.</line>
    <line id="10001442">Of course. There is only one decision, right?</line>
    <line id="10001443">You have no place among the Daves.</line>
    <line id="10001444">Wrong! I'm better than any one of you. Test me. Let's do this right now.</line>
    <line id="10001445">You have no place within DedSec either.</line>
    <line id="10001446">What the fuck? Do have any idea what I can do?</line>
    <line id="10001447">You can talk. You can pose. But you don't understand. We work anonymously. There is no "you" in DedSec.</line>
    <line id="10001448">Yeah, well there is a "U" in Ded-Suck.</line>
    <line id="10001451">DedSec. I'm gonna snoop around a little and see what I can find.</line>
    <line id="10001452">Why did you waste our time, badboy?</line>
    <line id="10001453">Defalt's as good as he says. He just needs to learn when to shut up.</line>
    <line id="10001454">You know what - you wasted MY time. All of you. I give your rinky-dink shit a year at best.</line>
    <line id="10001456">I found your friends dead in the Ambrose.</line>
    <line id="10001457">Leave me alone.</line>
    <line id="10001458">I'm trying to warn you, dipshit. You guys need to go underground.</line>
    <line id="10001463">Those are the same "Daves" I found in the Ambrose. Looks like this guy's trying to pin the murder on Defalt. Something feels off here.</line>
    <line id="10001465">Mind your own business.</line>
    <line id="10001466">Not the reaction I expected...</line>
    <line id="10001467">Something ain't lining up here. Let's check back in with my DedSec pal ... Looks like he made a recent call...</line>
    <line id="10001471">Ok, I've got them all gathered in one place. If you want your pay, get your guys over here and hit them NOW. Nobody gets out alive.</line>
    <line id="10001475">This asshole called a hit on his own people to kill his opposition. I ain't going to cry over a few blackhats, but this guy wants to unleash DedSec, and that will be a fucking disaster.</line>
    <line id="10001477">Listen to me, "Dave." One of your pals just ordered a hit on you and this place is about to become the epicenter of a shitstorm.</line>
    <line id="10001479">His hitmen could get here any second. I need to get ready for them.</line>
    <line id="10001481">Here they come...</line>
    <line id="10001483">I don't need it.</line>
    <line id="10001491">Looks like this guy's trying to sell Defalt as the threat here. I dunno. I would expect a lot more noise.</line>
    <line id="10001493">Damn. These are the same "Daves" from the Defalt video. The Ambrose was Defalt's old haunt, too... something feels too clean here.</line>
    <line id="10001495">So it's pretty clear to me now that the other Daves are going to waste the potential of what we've created here. In order to live up to our ideals, our purpose, they've left me one option - I need to remove them. Once we take our proper place ... once we're recognized as the ones who actually made a difference, who stood defiant against the one-percenter bullshit - people will understand why I had to do this. My brothers die for a cause they seem to have forgotten, but that cause lives on ... and grows stronger.</line>
    <line id="10001498">I've been working with another hacker lately. He knows the game, but his ego is too much. And he likes to keep his identity hidden behind a mask when he's in public. Like he's got to wear the silly costume or he's somehow exposed. He scares me sometimes. His ideas are violent. He angers easily. He's a genius, but he can be like a child. On one hand I think he could help me find the Bunker, but on the other, I fear what he'd do with it. He's ready to meet the Daves, but I don't know if the Daves are ready for Defalt. I don't know if anybody is ready for Defalt.</line>
    <line id="10001499">Damn, Clara. You were full of secrets, weren't you?</line>

I hopped into my truck, and thought I'd just drive out into the black, out where the rain goes horizontal, see if I could hitch a ride in a funnel and ride on up to Heaven ... or destinations south: Mexico. Figured I'd leave that call up to the big man. I didn't get far. Rode up on that motherfucker and my 6-by-6 blade of sheet metal comes flying out of nowhere and hacks right into my engine block. Whoa! Yeah, so I decided I was gonna need a beast of a machine to withstand that kind of natural ferocity. So I started building an armored car, right out of a drive-in movie, man.

    <line id="10001815">Took me about two years to escape Raymond Kenney proper. It wasn't just erasing him, either--I had to do that anyway to avoid the law. But I was proud of who I was. The things I'd built. And they found the ugliest fucking picture they could and plastered it on every TV from coast to coast. I mean butt-ugly. People I never met were featured on prime-time talking about my drinking habits and quick temper. Yeah, Raymond Kenney was called every name in the goddamn book. So, I needed a new identity--something simple that wouldn't draw attention. "T-Bone" just kinda popped into my head. That was a name nobody would think twice about. T-Bone was just a grumpy man with a junkyard on the edge of town. "T-Bone" never bothered anybody. Never asked any questions and didn't answer any, neither. And then Blume showed up in his backyard.</line>
    <line id="10001818">Spent a lot of time here trying to get my head together after the blackout.</line>
    <line id="10001821">I've been thinking about whether I should keep on  running or turn myself in. I even have a little press kit put together to expose everything I know about Blume--and believe me, I know enough. It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out what the ctOS is going to do. Besides, I worked with a goddamn mathematician and he agreed with me. Thing is--I'm not afraid to do my time, but Blume will make sure I never get out. And you bet your ass they'll slap a muzzle on me - oh yeah, they've already got one on the media. I always believed one man could make a difference and... I guess I'm just now realizing ... I ain't that man.</line>
    <line id="10001823">Here it is. I remember the first time I came here, I had a full book of homemade LSD. I was only gonna take a couple of squares, but the cops rolled up on me, so I just started eating paper as fast as I could. They just wanted to ask me questions about a nearby smash and grab. I just barely held my shit together until they left. Yeah, three days later, I woke up in a sewage drain, the lone survivor of a robot apocalypse.</line>

    <line id="10003148">The Chicago South Club has entered a new era of blatant violence under the suspected leadership of Niall Quinn, son of the former mafia boss Lucky Quinn. Several recent "shock and awe" attacks have been linked to the organization as it tries to reestablish dominance in the criminal hierarchy. </line>
    <line id="10003149">"Fixer" is a label for a broad range of modern mercenaries for hire. They are known for their ability to get any job done, no matter the skill set and that includes everything from trigger men to high-tech hackers. In a city controlled by a central operating system, Fixer business is booming.</line>
    <line id="10003150">Originally from Pawnee, but rapidly expanding, the Militia members are the new kids on the block, seizing an opportunity to step up their game. They’re military trained, heavily armed, and they don’t trust anybody.</line>

    <line id="10003152">Ray. I'm here.</line>
    <line id="10003154">A 19-year-old man was admitted to the hospital early this morning after falling into a construction excavation and remains in serious condition. While Blume has been silent about the deployment of ctOS 2.0, the increase in city construction has caused a lot of speculation. However, Chicagoans are urged not to try to take a "peek behind the curtains" as these zones are safety regulated and hazardous without proper equipment.</line>
    <line id="10003155">Friends and family of the late Mayor Donovan Rushmore met with protests yesterday as they celebrated a new scholarship fund launched in the former politician's name. While organizers boast Rushmore's positive accomplishments, including the city-wide implementation of ctOS, his detractors argue that an educational award named for a murderer is unethical ... and disgusting.</line>
    <line id="10003156">The Chicago South Club only recently buried their criminal patriarch, Dermot Quinn, but his son, Niall Quinn, was questioned by the CPD this week for his suspected involvement in a series of fire bombings throughout Mad Mile. We're told that although no charges have been made, Police will continue to put pressure on the Club to prevent another "Lucky."</line>
    <line id="10003157">A new lead on the disappearances of Nicole and Jackson Pearce, the sister and nephew of alleged vigilante, Aiden Pearce. While Police initially suspected foul play, multiple reports of the mother and child spotted at restaurants and gas stations along Route 66 appear to contradict that conclusion. If you have spotted the Pearce family, please call the CPD via their anonymous tip line.</line>
    <line id="10003158">Once again, activists in the Wards are calling for the demolition of Rossi-Fremont, the troubled housing project where several recent shootouts have claimed over thirty lives. Where once there was a promise of a place to call home, now there is only a constant barrage of drug-trafficking, prostitution, and violence. However, it's not as simple as tearing down the buildings--the city must find replacement homes for any displaced residents. City Council tells us there is a plan in the works, but for many, it just won't come fast enough.</line>
    <line id="10003159">Just what is the Pawnee Militia and why has it come to Chicago? We sat down with one of its anonymous leaders and asked that question. The answer seemed more like a warning, quote: "We are like-minded, military trained citizens tired of doing nothing while our freedoms are stripped away one politician at a time. This movement is not confined to rural areas. It will reach your doorstep and you will have to decide if you stand with America, or against it.</line>
    <line id="10003160">Electronic musician Defalt is trending in social media after footage of last month's bizarre show appeared online. The rat-faced DJ abandoned his set mid-way through the performance after a run-in with alleged vigilante Aiden Pearce. Fans are left wondering--was the whole encounter staged, or was Defalt simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Whichever the case, sales for Defalt's newest album have gone up.</line>

    <line id="10003163">Social Media is abuzz with reports of a so-called "Anarchist" loose on the streets of Chicago. Though some have been quick to label him another Vigilante, this man's M.O. appears to have him hitting targets of opportunity and stealing from crime scenes. We spoke with CPD Detective Sheila Billings and this is what she had to say:</line>
    <line id="10003165">Thieves are nothing new to Chicago and when you've got gangs killing rival gangs, of course vulture's are going to swoop in and pick up whatever's left behind. Our focus remains on crime detection and prevention. If we pick this guy up in the process, that's a bonus.</line>
    <line id="10003167">Reports are coming in about another attack by Chicago's "Anarchist." While police originally labeled him a petty thief, he's quickly becoming a real threat to public safety. If you have any information, please contact the police through their anonymous tip line.</line>
    <line id="10003168">The "Anarchist" has struck again and Chicagoans now fear getting caught in his path. Though his identity is still unknown, he is described as a bearded man wearing a backpack and cap. We'll update when we know more.</line>
    <line id="10003169">The man social media has dubbed an "Anarchist" has been involved in yet another violent crime and anyone with information leading to his capture should contact the authorities. The CPD warns not to approach this man as he is unpredictable and dangerous.</line>
    <line id="10003171">Following in the footsteps of Chicago's Vigilante, a man that social media is calling an Anarchist has been causing a lot of trouble for Chicago's various criminal gangs. The Police remind us: a crime is a crime, no matter how you justify it, and he will be brought to justice.</line>
    <line id="10003172">Armed with some have described as a demolition tool, Chicago's "Anarchist" has been taking his own bite out of crime, causing some to wonder - has Aiden Pearce returned? The CPD has no comment at this time.</line>
    <line id="10003173">Is Chicago looking for someone to cheer for now that vigilante Aiden Pearce has disappeared? That seems to be the case, given the media buzz surrounding a man dubbed the "Anarchist." Though his identity is unknown, one thing is clear--Chicago's police are not impressed.</line>

    <line id="10003205">Normal-normal. I just need enough time to hack them and see if I can find something to work with. You just walk--I'll keep up.</line>

    <line id="10003219">I don't even know what a release button looks like.</line>

    <line id="10003248">Frewer, I'm stuck. Can you do something?</line>

    <line id="10003263">Ok. I'm moving...</line>
    <line id="10003264">Doesn't look like this is a base of operations. More like a cleanup job. Still, I bet we can find some answers here.</line>
    <line id="10003265">Here. I think this will help.</line>
    <line id="10003267">Ray--whatever you just did unlocked the door back here. I'm going to sneak in.</line>

    <line id="10003290">After last month's violent attacks on Blume and even the ctOS itself, it's no surprise that the company has been looking to improve their security. Blume has announced the hiring of ex-Army Major Roger Verrick as the head of security in Chicago. It remains to be seen whether or not Verrick's military background will have an impact on ctOS protocols and in turn, what effect that will have on the public.</line>

    <line id="10003481">Take a good, long look in the mirror.</line>
    <line id="10003482">The real you wants to come out. Let him come out!</line>
    <line id="10003483">It's entirely possible you've lost your fucking mind.</line>
    <line id="10003484">You kept it bottled up too long but now it's coming out.</line>
    <line id="10003485">You can't keep it contained!</line>
    <line id="10003486">You can't run from the truth, amigo.</line>
    <line id="10003487">You deserve this. All of it.</line>
    <line id="10003488">You could be so much better if you'd just let loose.</line>
    <line id="10003489">You're holding back! You're always holding back!</line>
    <line id="10003490">Maybe you should just give up. Run and hide. That's what you do best.</line>
    <line id="10003491">I'm stuffed, how about you?</line>
    <line id="10003492">They never saw it coming!</line>

    <line id="10003494">How does that taste, huh?</line>
    <line id="10003495">Look at that appetite! Damn!</line>
    <line id="10003496">You're not paying attention!</line>
    <line id="10003497">There's too much bullshit weighing you down.</line>
    <line id="10003498">You're drowning!</line>
    <line id="10003499">You've gotten so old… what's happened to you?</line>
    <line id="10003505">You look familiar. But then again, we're all familiar here.</line>
    <line id="10003506">Step on up. We have some issues to sort out.</line>
    <line id="10003507">Once you get behind the wheel, there's only one winner. You or the road.</line>
    <line id="10003508">Are we doing this? Yeah, let's do this.</line>
    <line id="10003509">Is it the end of the world or the end of YOUR world? Let's find out.</line>
    <line id="10003510">Step up and do something about it.</line>
    <line id="10003511">Nothing to fear but yourself.</line>
    <line id="10003512">Think you got it? Prove it.</line>
    <line id="10003513">Stop running from yourself. Stand for something.</line>

    <line id="10003527">He ran. He hid. How can you hide from this?</line>
    <line id="10003528">How does he live with himself?</line>
    <line id="10003529">How does he look in the mirror?</line>
    <line id="10003530">There's still an open wound.</line>
    <line id="10003531">He can never make things right again.</line>
    <line id="10003532">Why did he come back? Hasn't he hurt</line>
    <line id="10003533">Someday he’ll answer for all of this. That’s a promise.</line>
    <line id="10003534">2 targets remaining.</line>
    <line id="10003535">1 target remaining.</line>
    <line id="10003537">Alright, I can handle this one.</line>
    <line id="10003538">Sounds good to me. I'm in.</line>
    <line id="10003539">Thanks for the info. I'll get 'er done.</line>
    <line id="10003540">Sounds promising. I'm up for it.</line>
    <line id="10003541">Alright, sounds good.</line>
    <line id="10003542">No problem. I'll take care of it.</line>
    <line id="10003543">Consider it done.</line>
    <line id="10003544">Okay. I'll see what I can do.</line>
    <line id="10003546">That's more like it.</line>
    <line id="10003547">Let's hope this works</line>

    <line id="10003587">You gotta help me out. I'm pinned.</line>
    <line id="10003589">Really don't want to die here, Ray.</line>

    <line id="10003624">Ray -- I dug up the blueprints on this place. I am marking it for you. I'm already headed over there.</line>
    <line id="10003626">I can see you, Ray!</line>
    <line id="10003627">Raymond Kenney, come on down!</line>

    <line id="10003661">Got a question for you, Mystery Man...</line>
    <line id="10003662">Hey, are you up for another run?</line>
    <line id="10003663">We uncovered a list of the Fixer targets--there were children on it. We're going to move those people to safety, but we've also got details on their two remaining strike teams.</line>
    <line id="10003664">Alright, I'm sending you the details on the last Fixer hit squad. This information should be solid.</line>
    <line id="10003665">Got an update for me?</line>
    <line id="10003666">Checking in, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003667">Good. I think we're getting close to ending this. I've got a solid lead, but I'm not ready to move on it just yet. I'll let you know.</line>
    <line id="10003668">Tell me you got them.</line>
    <line id="10003669">Give me good news.</line>
    <line id="10003670">I've got a tip the Chicago South Club's about to flex its muscles. Anything you can do?</line>
    <line id="10003671">I've got good news.</line>
    <line id="10003672">We've got another player in the Chicago South Club drama--a captain in the Pawnee Militia has been spitting threats. Hasn't acted on them yet.</line>
    <line id="10003673">Looks like our puppet-mastery created a problem. I need you to help me fix it.</line>
    <line id="10003674">I need you to be real fucking honest with me. Are you the guy they're calling "The Anarchist" on TV?</line>
    <line id="10003675">Now that these Militia gorillas are part of a crime scene, we'll be able to search their cars and homes to see if we can uncover their plans.</line>
    <line id="10003676">Did you shut them down?</line>
    <line id="10003677">I take it you're done?</line>
    <line id="10003678">Still alive?</line>
    <line id="10003679">We got the Blume workers out. Did you intercept the Militia?</line>
    <line id="10003680">Sent a PHD of your own, huh?</line>
    <line id="10003681">Sounds like you terrorized the Club. I'd kill to hear what it sounds like in their boardroom today.</line>
    <line id="10003682">Got word from my CIs, Niall's blaming that attack on Ugo. Mission accomplished.</line>
    <line id="10003683">Did you get it done?</line>
    <line id="10003684">Holy shit. While you were busy covering Ugo's ass, Ugo drove over to Niall's clubhouse and called him out himself. Stupid. Just stupid.</line>
    <line id="10003685">Got a real scary threat from the Pawnee Militia forwarded to my office today.</line>
    <line id="10003686">Our searches turned up gold. These guys aren't targeting the public. They're actually going to hit Blume.</line>
    <line id="10003687">Mystery Man, you said you'd leave the ctOS up "for now." What did you mean by that?</line>
    <line id="10003688">One more Militia crew, Mystery Man. I need you to move on this.</line>
    <line id="10003689">I need you moving NOW. We've got a crisis.</line>
    <line id="10003706">Hit these guys hard, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003741">Are you clear?</line>
    <line id="10003742">Great. Thanks, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003746">Tell me the good news.</line>
    <line id="10003747">good. You are relieved, uh--soldier.</line>
    <line id="10003748">How'd it go?</line>
    <line id="10003749">Wonderful. Thanks, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003750">There you are. I'll assume you're still kicking?</line>
    <line id="10003751">Checking in...</line>
    <line id="10003752">Find anything you can use?</line>
    <line id="10003753">Alright. Everything ok?</line>
    <line id="10003755">Never had a doubt.</line>
    <line id="10003756">Are you there?</line>
    <line id="10003757">I think I underestimated the Pawnee Militia. They've gone high-tech. They've even tapped into the ctOS. I've got a lock on one of the vehicles they're using to hack in, but there's a problem.</line>
    <line id="10003758">Mystery Man, I've got an oddball task for you.</line>
    <line id="10003759">Did you wipe out the list?</line>
    <line id="10003760">I could use your help. Cybercrimes is in a panic.</line>
    <line id="10003761">So that's what you look like.</line>
    <line id="10003762">You dropped off the grid!</line>
    <line id="10003763">I just got word he's safe. Thank you. Let's hope this didn't scare him away from his testimony.</line>
    <line id="10003764">I've got something for you, but you're going to need some wheels.</line>
    <line id="10003765">Mystery Man. If you're up for the drive, I've got a job for you.</line>
    <line id="10003766">I need you behind a wheel. This job is going to be tricky.</line>
    <line id="10003767">Going to put your road skills to use, Mystery Man. Are you game?</line>
    <line id="10003768">OK, I've got a job for you, but you'll have to do some driving. I hope you're up for it.</line>
    <line id="10003769">I need you on the road, Mystery Man. Got some action for you.</line>
    <line id="10003770">I've got a problem you can help me with, but things are about to escalate. Are you in?</line>
    <line id="10003771">I hope you're ready to ride because there's no time to waste.</line>
    <line id="10003772">I need you to grab your car and move. Got a job for you.</line>
    <line id="10003773">I need you to grab a car and hit the road. Are you ready?</line>
    <line id="10003774">Nice driving, Mystery Man. You earned this.</line>
    <line id="10003775">Where did you learn to drive like that? You know what... forget I asked. Nice work.</line>
    <line id="10003776">While I won't say I'm a fan of your driving, you came through for me. Thanks.</line>
    <line id="10003777">Score one for the good guys. Nice driving.</line>
    <line id="10003778">Sometimes you scare me, Mystery Man. That was some insane driving - but it paid off.</line>
    <line id="10003779">I swear you give new meaning to the term "road rage." I'm glad you're working for me.</line>
    <line id="10003780">We did some good here today, Mystery Man. Great driving.</line>
    <line id="10003781">Fantastic driving. You're worth every penny, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003782">You are hell on wheels, my friend. Well done.</line>
    <line id="10003783">Bet those assholes never saw you coming. Amazing work.</line>
    <line id="10003784">Good. Give me a call before you go in.</line>
    <line id="10003785">before respawn</line>
    <line id="10003787">Sheila, I'm at the spot and about to head in.</line>
    <line id="10003788">Alright. Watch yourself in there. These guys are connected. If they weren't, You know I'd have them behind bars already. Somebody's keeping my hands tied, which means they've got friends in high places, which means...</line>
    <line id="10003789">...they've got the best gear money can buy. I'm counting on that.</line>
    <line id="10003790">Don't get too cocky. I'm sending you all the information I've collected on them so you know just what you're getting into.</line>
    <line id="10003791">Thank you, detective.</line>
    <line id="10003792">I'm here. What's wrong?</line>
    <line id="10003793">I've got a Club witness on the move and I got a tip there's going to be a hit on him. I need this man's testimony. Understand?</line>
    <line id="10003794">Can't you get him under witness protection?</line>
    <line id="10003795">He's supposed to be. But I have a feeling his escort's going to look the other way.</line>
    <line id="10003796">Shit. Alright. Send me the details.</line>
    <line id="10003798">I'll put plastic flamingos and a swimming pool on the table. That usually hooks them.</line>
    <line id="10003799">Yeah. Hard offer to refuse.</line>
    <line id="10003800">Can't say I'd blame him.</line>
    <line id="10003801">I hear you. This time, though ... Fixers hacked into the police database. They've got the names of every undercover we've got in the field. They've already got it up for sale.</line>
    <line id="10003802">Now I understand the panic.</line>
    <line id="10003803">People think the CPD is behind the times. It's not true. In fact, we've got a lock on them now ... we just don't have the green light to move on it. If I point you to them--can you wipe the data clean?</line>
    <line id="10003804">Now that you've given me the green light. Yup.</line>
    <line id="10003805">Well, they should be. They're fighting a losing battle.</line>
    <line id="10003806">One of our own sold us out for a third of the price they ended up asking.</line>
    <line id="10003807">Figures.</line>
    <line id="10003808">Thanks for the assist.</line>
    <line id="10003809">No problemo.</line>
    <line id="10003810">Indeed I did. All your cops playin' dress up are safe for now. Ever figure out how they stole it?</line>
    <line id="10003811">Niall Quinn. He's a mad dog compared to his daddy. Since he stepped up, the body count's been rising.</line>
    <line id="10003812">PHD.</line>
    <line id="10003813">Excuse me?</line>
    <line id="10003814">PHD - a prison howdy-do. Find the biggest, meanest hombre you can and tear him a new one. Show people that you got what it takes. That's what Lucky's boy is doing. You want me to hit them back, make him look bad. I can do that.</line>
    <line id="10003815">I know you can.</line>
    <line id="10003816">Reckon there's a lot I can do, but I thought these guys were small potatoes with Lucky gone. What's got you nervous?</line>
    <line id="10003817">Oh, yeah. I like to stick with the classics.</line>
    <line id="10003818">You're making Niall Quinn look bad. Keep it up, and his goons are going to start losing faith.</line>
    <line id="10003819">Oh, you want him to disappear.</line>
    <line id="10003820">I can't touch him. But I can cause his own crew to question him. Maybe they'll even take him out for me.</line>
    <line id="10003821">You are a scary lady.</line>
    <line id="10003822">You remember that.</line>
    <line id="10003823">Lay it on me...</line>
    <line id="10003824">Found some Pawnee Militia floaters in the river.</line>
    <line id="10003825">You're kinda weird sometimes.</line>
    <line id="10003826">The shooters were Chicago South Club. Sounds like it's election season for the mob and somebody's starting his campaign.</line>
    <line id="10003827">I want a vote.</line>
    <line id="10003828">You've got one.</line>
    <line id="10003830">I like to operate more on a street level.</line>
    <line id="10003831">That's why I love you. I mean ... you know what I mean.</line>
    <line id="10003832">Yeah ... so...</line>
    <line id="10003833">Oh come on. Don't. Don't make this fucking awkward. I have no interest.</line>
    <line id="10003834">The lady doth protest too much, methinks.</line>
    <line id="10003835">Don't you Shakespeare me either! You are evil.</line>
    <line id="10003836">You got a name?</line>
    <line id="10003837">Calls himself Ugo.</line>
    <line id="10003838">Ugo, huh? I knew a Ugo once. Had the biggest fuckin' hair-lip. He was missing teeth, too, so you could see his damn uvula even when his mouth was closed.</line>
    <line id="10003839">What are we talking about here?</line>
    <line id="10003840">You want me to hit Niall's crew so he'll pin it on Ugo.</line>
    <line id="10003841">Right. We're on the same page, then.</line>
    <line id="10003842">That's what I like to hear.</line>
    <line id="10003843">I just want to make sure they keep the inevitable showdown contained. I don't want this spilling onto my streets. Speaking of which ... I don't want to hear about YOU catching civilians in the crossfire either. We clear?</line>
    <line id="10003844">Don't worry about me. I got it under control.</line>
    <line id="10003845">Of course. What do we do?</line>
    <line id="10003846">Niall's crew is about to make a move on the Militia in a very public place.</line>
    <line id="10003847">Yeah, that ain't happening on my watch. I'll take care of it.</line>
    <line id="10003848">I did.</line>
    <line id="10003849">Word on the street -- Ugo's about hit Niall Quinn. We've got our dog ready for the fight now. Let's hope he's got what it takes.</line>
    <line id="10003850">It ain't the size of the fight in the dog, it's the size of the--oh shit, I fucked that up, didn't I? Well, you know what I mean.</line>
    <line id="10003851">Sometimes I wonder…</line>
    <line id="10003852">I don't watch TV.</line>
    <line id="10003853">Shit. Shit. I thought so. At least tell me what they're saying about you is just media hype. I need to believe that.</line>
    <line id="10003854">Of course it is. You know me.</line>
    <line id="10003855">I don't, really. But you've done a lot to help people, so I have to take your word for it. Listen, this is it. Ugo's boys are making their move. I need you to make sure Niall's support crew is "delayed."</line>
    <line id="10003856">Yeah. I will. Don't worry.</line>
    <line id="10003859">You tell 'em, Ugo.</line>
    <line id="10003860">Oh, he told him. And Niall just laughed. Ugo's own crew turned on him. Bought by the Club. Executed him on the spot. One of our CIs was there to see it. The details were ... graphic.</line>
    <line id="10003861">So that's one dead boss, even if it's the wrong one. Plus a bunch of Chicago South Club along the way. I call that a victory.</line>
    <line id="10003862">Yeah ... absolutely. But. We're underestimating Quinn's boy. This guy may be every bit the politician his daddy was. We need to keep the pressure on him. Make sure he never claims the throne.</line>
    <line id="10003863">Getting real tired of these pricks.</line>
    <line id="10003864">You and me both. Any ideas on how to beat them?</line>
    <line id="10003865">You can't. It's not a group, it's an occupation. If there's cash to be made, you'll always have more Fixers. Best you can do is target one of the cells working a job and ruin it for them. Then you just have to hope that doesn't put a contract on you.</line>
    <line id="10003866">Well I've got a cell for you, then. These guys have been targeting white collar workers. People with security connections into corporate accounts.</line>
    <line id="10003867">Thieves?</line>
    <line id="10003868">Killers. We've got bodies. I know who is involved but I can't move on them. That's where you come in.</line>
    <line id="10003869">Yupper. Got her done. Was that all of them?</line>
    <line id="10003870">No. And this doesn't seem to be money driven anymore. We've linked two of the victims. They were cousins.</line>
    <line id="10003871">Damn. Sounds like this is wetwork, then.</line>
    <line id="10003872">That's what I'm thinking. I'll keep digging and let you know what we find.</line>
    <line id="10003873">Oh, T-Bone...</line>
    <line id="10003874">Wallet, keys, gun, knife.</line>
    <line id="10003875">Shoot.</line>
    <line id="10003876">How do you know about the Fixers?</line>
    <line id="10003877">Let's just say I made their list ... so sometimes I like to get close and see what they know. Run a few jobs with them here and there to find out how they operate.</line>
    <line id="10003878">You're crazy!</line>
    <line id="10003879">You ain't the first to say it. Nobody's recognized me so far, though, because I been working with crews that ain't actually looking for me.</line>
    <line id="10003880">Speaking of which ... I have tabs on that Fixer group we're after. You game?</line>
    <line id="10003881">Yup.</line>
    <line id="10003882">Yeah, I was just finishing up here. You figure out what these Fixers are after?</line>
    <line id="10003883">The Chicago South Club.</line>
    <line id="10003884">Then why the hell are we stopping them?</line>
    <line id="10003885">Because they're hitting targets outside the criminal side of the Club. Extended family. Business contacts. Why do you think they're doing that?</line>
    <line id="10003886">To shake them up. Keep them busy with protecting the people they don't usually have to protect. You let me know when you find out more.</line>
    <line id="10003887">Yes Ma'am.</line>
    <line id="10003888">Ma'am. I like that. Listen - there's been another hit--a drive-by this time. Four dead. Loose connections to the Chicago South Club. We were able to track the men involved, but I don't have time to wait for proper channels.</line>
    <line id="10003889">Well, that's why you've got an improper channel.</line>
    <line id="10003890">Sheila, I took care of the Fixers.</line>
    <line id="10003891">We need to hit them before they kill next time.</line>
    <line id="10003892">That's the idea.</line>
    <line id="10003893">You just made my day. Tell me who and where.</line>
    <line id="10003894">CPD will move on these guys soon, so you need to move fast if you want to get to them first. I want you to understand something--you know I don't like when you make a mess.</line>
    <line id="10003895">Yeah, I know.</line>
    <line id="10003896">This time ... you make all the mess you want. Are we clear?</line>
    <line id="10003897">Hey, are you okay?</line>
    <line id="10003898">I'm just fed up.</line>
    <line id="10003899">I know. I am too.</line>
    <line id="10003900">Done.</line>
    <line id="10003901">Listen. I'm sorry I crossed a line earlier. It's just that sometimes I feel like I'd be doing more good out there with you than I do here.</line>
    <line id="10003902">That ain't true, Sheila. Don't forget, I've seen your arrest records. Your commendations. I'm just some thug who sometimes manages to be in the right place at the right time. We need more people like you in places like yours. You got me?</line>
    <line id="10003903">That's what I keep telling myself. Hell, I don't even know if I believe that anymore. Hey--we've got one more of these Fixer groups to track down. We should have the details soon.</line>
    <line id="10003904">Yeah, you let me know.</line>
    <line id="10003905">We'll get these guys. Promise.</line>
    <line id="10003906">Just wish we'd been faster about it. Can't shake the feeling we were a step behind.</line>
    <line id="10003907">Hey, it's thanks to YOU we caught up with them in the first place. It's almost over.</line>
    <line id="10003908">They won't be hurting nobody again. Made sure of that.</line>
    <line id="10003909">Thank God.</line>
    <line id="10003910">We did it, Sheila. You and me.</line>
    <line id="10003911">What's your name?</line>
    <line id="10003912">What?</line>
    <line id="10003913">Just your first name. You can trust me.</line>
    <line id="10003914">Yeah. It's ... Eugene.</line>
    <line id="10003915">For real?</line>
    <line id="10003916">What's wrong with Eugene?</line>
    <line id="10003917">No, nothing. It's perfect, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003918">Scary how?</line>
    <line id="10003919">Like a terrorist telling you where he's going to strike.</line>
    <line id="10003920">What the fuck?</line>
    <line id="10003921">I know, right? A list of large public venues and their maximum capacity and a shopping list of demolition-level explosives.</line>
    <line id="10003922">Any propaganda with it?</line>
    <line id="10003923">Nope, just the logo. There's plenty of propaganda on their website, though. I've been watching a group of these psychos in Chicago...</line>
    <line id="10003924">Yeah. I follow--hit 'em, see what kind of noise it makes.</line>
    <line id="10003925">Let me know what you find. These guys went from preppers to revolutionaries real fast. Hell, even Blume used these guys as a temporary workforce for their own security.</line>
    <line id="10003926">They're playing the black market just like everybody else. All the threats and propaganda's just a front to keep eyes off the prize. I guarantee you. Just a bunch of rural crazies... yeah, sure.</line>
    <line id="10003927">I've employed the same technique myself. Yesiree.</line>
    <line id="10003928">Oh, hell yeah!</line>
    <line id="10003930">You could say that.</line>
    <line id="10003931">They've got several crews planning these bombings. You work on the first one.</line>
    <line id="10003932">You've got a problem with Blume?</line>
    <line id="10003933">Putting aside the fact that the Militia plan to explode bombs in my city, I don't want to deal with another ctOS blackout. We saw the chaos that causes.</line>
    <line id="10003934">Yup. Besides, I need the ctOS up and running ... for now.</line>
    <line id="10003935">Was there ever any doubt?</line>
    <line id="10003936">Not from me. Things are about to get nasty out there, though. Looks like Blume's caught wind of the Militia plot.</line>
    <line id="10003937">They do have a camera on every corner. Let me guess, they've got Fixers on it.</line>
    <line id="10003938">Sounds like it.</line>
    <line id="10003939">Pawnee Militia's out of their league.</line>
    <line id="10003940">People will wake up at some point and realize they don't really like the taste of what they're being fed.</line>
    <line id="10003941">Sounds like something the Pawnee Militia would say.</line>
    <line id="10003942">I ain't spouting ignorance here, believe me. I've seen the insides of the ctOS.</line>
    <line id="10003943">How?</line>
    <line id="10003944">So you're sending me after the next Militia target?</line>
    <line id="10003945">Yeah. Good luck.</line>
    <line id="10003946">I am. Sheila ... about your questions before. I don't want you to think I'm like these guys. I'm not.</line>
    <line id="10003947">I know you're not. I just want to know who you are. Why won't you tell me more?</line>
    <line id="10003948">Because if I did, our little partnership would be over.</line>
    <line id="10003949">That's ominous.</line>
    <line id="10003950">Yeah, didn't mean it to be.</line>
    <line id="10003951">Brought my dancing shoes. Where?</line>
    <line id="10003952">Here you go. You watch yourself.</line>
    <line id="10003953">Is that genuine concern I hear in your voice?</line>
    <line id="10003954">Of course it is. You're out there because of me.</line>
    <line id="10003955">You need to know something. If I disappear again ... you assume the BEST, OK? I ain't gonna die out here. We'll talk when I get this job done.</line>
    <line id="10003956">Still alive ... and in better shape than the Militia. Is this over?</line>
    <line id="10003957">You took down all their heavy hitters in Chicago. They're going to blame the Fixers ... and Blume. There may be retaliation. I'll call you when I know for sure.</line>
    <line id="10003958">Alright, you do that.</line>
    <line id="10003959">Shit. What is it?</line>
    <line id="10003960">Since we stopped the Militia's demolition plans, they think the Fixers have declared war on them. They're readying a crew to hit the Blume central office, just to make a point. They aren't targeting Fixers, they're going to kill the suits. The innocents.</line>
    <line id="10003961">Ok, ok--Damn. I'll get in their way.</line>
    <line id="10003962">I'm sending a squad to the office to secure those people while you try to stop the Militia.</line>
    <line id="10003963">They won't be hurting anybody.</line>
    <line id="10003964">Thank you. This is huge--we saved a lot of lives here. I know you don't like helping Blume.</line>
    <line id="10003965">I'm against the message, not the messengers. Well not all the messengers.</line>
    <line id="10003966">Let me help you. Tell me what this is about. I have connections.</line>
    <line id="10003967">Thank you Sheila, but no. I'm already putting you at risk just working with you. I'm not pulling you into my nightmare.</line>
    <line id="10003968">The offer's on the table, Mystery Man. It'll stay there.</line>
    <line id="10003969">Damn. Ok.</line>
    <line id="10003977">It's a wash, Sheila.</line>
    <line id="10003978">Sorry, I couldn't get it done this time.</line>
    <line id="10003979">Can't win them all, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10003980">I tried, Sheila. Didn't pan out.</line>
    <line id="10003981">That's how it goes sometimes.</line>
    <line id="10003982">I fucked it up this time.</line>
    <line id="10003983">Alright. At least we tried.</line>
    <line id="10003984">I couldn't pull it off, Sheila.</line>
    <line id="10003985">Okay ... I'll see if I can get the sqaud on it.</line>
    <line id="10003986">Sheila - I couldn't make it happen.</line>
    <line id="10003987">Damn. Thanks for letting me know.</line>
    <line id="10003988">Sheila, I got bad news.</line>
    <line id="10003989">I know, I heard. It's alright.</line>
    <line id="10003990">It's a no-go, Detective.</line>
    <line id="10003991">Alright. I understand.</line>
    <line id="10003992">You got it.</line>
    <line id="10003993">You know what to do.</line>
    <line id="10003994">I know what to do.</line>
    <line id="10003995">Ready to roll?</line>
    <line id="10003996">I never stop.</line>
    <line id="10003997">Got what you need?</line>
    <line id="10003998">Hell, anything I don't have, I'll take from these assholes. I'm going in.</line>
    <line id="10003999">Don't get shot out there.</line>
    <line id="10004000">Not in my plans...</line>
    <line id="10004001">You watch your collateral dammage, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10004002">I always do.</line>
    <line id="10004003">Good luck out there.</line>
    <line id="10004004">Let's hope so. I'm gonna need it.</line>
    <line id="10004006">Sheila, I'm heading in.</line>
    <line id="10004013">Time to clean up here, Mystery Man.</line>
    <line id="10004014">Yup. Today I'm playing the neat freak.</line>
    <line id="10004015">I want you to make sure these guys are done.</line>
    <line id="10004016">You and me both, Sheila.</line>
    <line id="10004017">These guys are linked to at least a dozen violent crimes. Do what you need to.</line>
    <line id="10004018">Oh I will.</line>
    <line id="10004019">Think you can do this?</line>
    <line id="10004020">I think I can do this. Let's do this.</line>
    <line id="10004021">All set?</line>
    <line id="10004022">Yeah. Let's see if I can get a drop on these assholes.</line>
    <line id="10004023">I still need you, so don't get yourself killed out there.</line>
    <line id="10004024">I will do my best.</line>
    <line id="10004025">You have any problems out there, you call me.</line>
    <line id="10004026">You'll be the first to know. Relax. I ain't expecting any problems.</line>
    <line id="10004027">How are you feeling? Ready to do this?</line>
    <line id="10004028">Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm going in.</line>
    <line id="10004029">You got a plan before you head in there?</line>
    <line id="10004030">Yup.</line>
    <line id="10004061">Ok. Good luck.</line>
    <line id="10004062">Sheila, I'm going to go pay these guys a visit.</line>
    <line id="10004063">They're not going to be happy about that.</line>
    <line id="10004064">I don't blame them.</line>
    <line id="10004065">Sheila, I'm about to do this. We'll talk when I'm done.</line>
    <line id="10004066">Be careful out there.</line>
    <line id="10004067">Sheila, I'm ready to roll.</line>
    <line id="10004068">We're doing a good thing here.</line>
    <line id="10004069">All out of bubblegum?</line>
    <line id="10004070">Yup.</line>
    <line id="10004071">Yup. All done here, Sheila.</line>
    <line id="10004072">Nice.</line>
    <line id="10004073">Sheila, it's done.</line>
    <line id="10004074">All done. I'm getting out of here, Sheila.</line>
    <line id="10004075">That's good news. Thanks.</line>
    <line id="10004076">I'm all wrapped up here, Detective.</line>
    <line id="10004077">You never cease to amaze. Thanks.</line>
    <line id="10004078">Work's done Sheila. No hitches.</line>
    <line id="10004079">That's what I like to hear. Fantastic.</line>
    <line id="10004080">Got 'er done. Everything went pretty smooth.</line>
    <line id="10004081">Like always.</line>
    <line id="10004082">Don't I wish.</line>
    <line id="10004083">Mission complete, Capitaine!</line>
    <line id="10004084">I'm still walking, so it went well. Talk to you soon.</line>
    <line id="10004085">Sheila. It's all wrapped up here.</line>
    <line id="10004086">I'm still still kicking. No worries, Sheila.</line>
    <line id="10004087">Hi! I'm all done here. Heading out.</line>
    <line id="10004088">Ok!</line>
    <line id="10004089">I admit nothing.</line>
    <line id="10004090">Great job in there.</line>
    <line id="10004091">All done, Sheila. I'm packing it up.</line>
    <line id="10004092">Peachy.</line>
    <line id="10004093">My work here is done.</line>
    <line id="10004094">Neither did I.</line>
    <line id="10004095">All done. I'm packing it up.</line>
    <line id="10004096">Alright. Everything ok?</line>
    <line id="10004097">Oh, just ducky.</line>
    <line id="10004098">Oooh. I'm intrigued.</line>
    <line id="10004099">The Club's been using the same car in a series of violent crimes, but I don't have enough evidence to request a warrant. Thing is, I am 100% sure this is going to pay off. Think you can bring it to me?</line>
    <line id="10004100">I'm always up for a joyride, baby.</line>
    <line id="10004101">No joyriding! I need this intact and unharmed. I don't want anyone to know we saw it. Understand?</line>
    <line id="10004102">You're no fun.</line>
    <line id="10004103">What did you do?</line>
    <line id="10004104">Saw you as you pulled up. You're kind of ... fuzzy.</line>
    <line id="10004105">Sheila. Listen to me. You need to stop trying to figure out who I am, girl. That's just asking for trouble.</line>
    <line id="10004106">Relax. I was just curious. It stops there. Thanks for the new wheels. I'll search the car top to bottom and see what I can find.</line>
    <line id="10004107">No problemo. Hey, and I ain't fuzzy. I'm grizzly.</line>
    <line id="10004109">Yeah, what's up, Sheila?</line>
    <line id="10004110">Well, I love a good problem. Let's hear it.</line>
    <line id="10004111">They've got a limited range. You get the car outside that range, they won't be able to fry the components remotely and we get to dissect them.</line>
    <line id="10004112">And what's stopping them from frying it as soon as I take the thing?</line>
    <line id="10004113">Speed. If you're moving fast enough, they can't get a lock on it.</line>
    <line id="10004114">Pedal to the metal, then. I can do that.</line>
    <line id="10004115">Woo-ee! Yeah! Delivered the prize. Haven't driven like that college when we used to play thirty-thirty.</line>
    <line id="10004116">Do I want to know?</line>
    <line id="10004117">No ... probably not.</line>
    <line id="10004118">I'll make sure this car is taken apart so we can figure out how they're tapping in. Thanks, Mystery Man.</line>

</line>
    <line id="10005133">Yeah, right. That's the reason they don't want you to take a peek behind the curtains. Blume cares so damn much about public safety.</line>
    <line id="10005135">Do people really believe Rushmore brought ctOS to Chicago? It was coming no matter what. Rushmore was just smart enough to step out of the path of the Blume steamroller. Hell, it ended up running him down anyway.</line>

    <line id="10005147">Well ain't that a pantload of bad news. Blume already sells tech to the military, we don't want to see them update their wedding vows.</line>
